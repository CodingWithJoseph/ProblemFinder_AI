### 🧭 Expanding Your Labeling System for Solution-Oriented Posts

#### 🧩 1️⃣ Keep Your Current Model Clean and Conservative
- Your existing model (`is_problem`, `is_software_solvable`, `is_external`) captures **explicit user frustration**.  
- Don’t broaden it to inferred opportunities — that weakens precision.  
- Think of it as your **baseline “pain detector.”**

---

#### 🧠 2️⃣ Build a Second-Stage “Opportunity” Model
- Train a separate classifier (or head) to identify *solution-sharing* or *implied opportunity* posts.  
- Example trigger phrases:
  - “Here’s how I solved…”
  - “If only there were a simpler way to…”
  - “I built X to fix Y…”
- Label this target `is_opportunity = 1` when users imply a *gap* or *innovation*.

---

#### 🔗 3️⃣ Combine Models for Richer Insight
Use the two outputs together:

| Problem Model | Opportunity Model | Interpretation |
|----------------|------------------|----------------|
| 1 | 0 | Explicit frustration → **pain point** |
| 0 | 1 | Implicit idea → **solution showcase / opportunity** |
| 1 | 1 | Pain + workaround → **high-value market signal** |
| 0 | 0 | Neutral or irrelevant |

This dual approach surfaces both **pain** and **innovation**, not just complaints.

---

#### ⚙️ 4️⃣ Implementation Strategy
- Reuse the same encoder (e.g., DeBERTa, RoBERTa)  
- Add a new classification head for `is_opportunity`  
- Use GPT-assisted labeling to bootstrap data  
- Fine-tune or run both models and **combine their predictions downstream**

---

#### 🧮 5️⃣ Is Ensembling the Best Approach?
**Yes — for now, it’s the most flexible and interpretable.**
- It lets each model specialize (pain vs. opportunity).  
- You can control thresholds separately and combine results (average logits, weighted sum, or logical OR).  
- It’s easier to debug and tune than merging all signals into a single multi-task model early on.  

Later, when both models are stable, you can **distill** them into one multi-label transformer — but start with ensembling for clarity.

---

✅ **Summary**
Keep your current model precise for *frustration detection*, train a second *opportunity detector*, and ensemble both to uncover **Market Viable Problems** that blend user pain with latent demand.
