Looking for a Projector within/around £300 in the UK for bedroom,"Hi BudgetProjectors!

I live in the UK in London and I'm looking for a home projector that i can use to watch movies/youtube/games in my bedroom with some flexibility  
  
We plan to get a portable stand so we can use it outside or at friends/family. It will mainly aim on a screen that is at a max distance of 4 Metres or closer and we havnt decided on the size of the screen yet but i think 110 inches is fine based on the rooms dimensions of 4.8m X 3.5m. 

Our Budget is around about £300-£400 more or less and dont mind getting things second hand or on sale.

I would like to connect a google stick or amazon stick or any other stick that allows me to watch things without needing pre-installed software that will most likely go out of date.

I dont know the price margins for 1080p/2k/4k, or the brightness/lumens ratios, or upscaling/downscaling capabilities for 4k content but I would like to have as much flexibility as reasonably possible.

With the research I've done so far I saw these projectors but unsure if they are good or not:  
PUTRIMS K12  
XGIMI MoGo 3 Pro  
XGIMI MoGo 2 Pro  
Nebula Capsule 3  
  
I saw some of these go on Sale recently and could of snagged the MoGo 3 Pro with a stand for £300 but didnt want to jump any gun!

Appreciate the help!",0,-
How bad is the 8 speed transmission of the 2017's?,"Hi there, looking at a 2017 Sienna AWD with about 65k miles (108k km)... I've read pre-february 2017 build date is worse than after... 

How bad are the transmission actually? To the point I'll definitely have issues? To avoid entirely? 

I've heard of a software reprogram, does that fix it for good? 

Also a TSB that gives an extended warranty... 

Anyhow, just wanted to know since it's a colleague who sells... Well priced and would be convenient in the timing and all. 

Thanks",1,not_applicable
Can You Actually Future-Proof a Supply Chain—Or Is That Just a Buzzword?,"**If I had a dollar for every time someone said their supply chain was “future-proof,” I’d have enough to buy a small fleet of refrigerated trucks and name each one after a buzzword from a vendor webinar.**

**Here’s the thing:**  
“Future-proof” sounds sexy in a strategy session. It looks sharp in slide decks, fits neatly in annual reports, and gives executives that warm, fuzzy feeling that *something* is under control.

But supply chains aren’t software. You can’t just “install” resilience and call it a day.

We live in a world where one ship gets stuck in one canal and half the planet ends up waiting for garden furniture. Where floods in Malaysia delay microchips in Detroit. Where a strike at a port you've never heard of suddenly derails your entire Q4.

But when you peel back the layers… can you *actually* future-proof a supply chain?

Short answer:  
**Not completely. You can’t future-proof a supply chain like it’s a VPN subscription.**

Longer, more useful answer:  
**You can’t stop disruption—but you** ***can*** **build a supply chain that knows how to flex instead of fractures.**

You can swap the dream of bulletproof logistics for the much smarter goal of being **shock-resistant, scenario-tested, and just unhinged enough to survive the unexpected.**

Let’s break down what “future-proofing” actually *means*—and how the companies doing it best aren’t trying to outrun disruption. They’re dancing with it.

**So why do companies keep getting caught off guard?**

Because most supply chains are built for *efficiency*, not *resilience*.

They’re optimised for:

* The fastest route
* The cheapest supplier
* The leanest inventory

Great when things are stable.  
Disastrous when they’re not.

**Future-proofing isn't about perfection. It's about preparation.**

It’s about building systems that say:

* “If this supplier goes dark, we already have a backup.”
* “If demand doubles overnight, our production line can flex.”
* “If freight costs spike, we’ve got visibility into better routes.”
* “If geopolitical chaos strikes, we’re not entirely reliant on one region.”

In other words:  
You may not know what’s coming. But you *know* something is—and you’ve already built in the shock absorbers.

**Here’s what that actually looks like in practice:**

🧠 **Multi-tier supply chain visibility**  
Not just knowing your supplier—but knowing *their* suppliers too.

📦 **Inventory agility, not just control**  
Buffer stock, regional warehouses, and demand-driven replenishment.

🌍 **Geographic diversification**  
No more “China + hope for the best.” Nearshoring and dual sourcing are the new risk insurance.

🚛 **Flexible logistics networks**  
Mixing in 3PLs, alternative modes, and dynamic routing to avoid bottlenecks.

📊 **Scenario modelling**  
Using AI and real-world data to plan “what if?” strategies before they become “oh no” situations.

**So, can you future-proof your** [**supply chain**](https://www.transportworks.com/)**?**

Not in the bulletproof, no-fail, crystal-ball sense.

But you can:

* Build for flexibility
* Design for disruption
* Train your team to adapt
* Use data to pivot faster than your competitors

And *that* is what separates the survivors from the companies writing crisis comms on a Friday night.",0,-
Budget Mini PC for Obsidian and more,"Hey everyone,

I've been skimming over this subreddit to look for information about some mini PCs as I am looking for the best ""bang for a buck"" solution. Beforce anything, I am located in Germany and in best case, I plan to order from Amazon.

I've been DMing with my friends on an old Dell Inspiron 15 5000 Laptop, about 10 Years old. With some YT Music via BT in the background, Obsidian as my management software and a second screen for pushing pictures to the players, it starts doing some hiccups after about 1 hour of running. Especially during breaks when I lock the screen, it doesnt fire up again and I need to hard reset.  
I've been thinking on using a third screen in the setup, but that is a nogo as the laptop only provides one HDMI output.

While I know that a simple Chaatrey T9 or a BlackView MP80 would do the job just fine, you never know what ideas you come up with in the future with such a mini PC. Especially after I've seen benchmarks ( [https://www.cpubenchmark.net/compare/4943vs4949vs4749vs5299vs4867/AMD-Ryzen-5-6600H-vs-AMD-Ryzen-5-6600U-vs-AMD-Ryzen-7-6800H-vs-AMD-Ryzen-7-7800X3D-vs-AMD-Ryzen-9-6900HX](https://www.cpubenchmark.net/compare/4943vs4949vs4749vs5299vs4867/AMD-Ryzen-5-6600H-vs-AMD-Ryzen-5-6600U-vs-AMD-Ryzen-7-6800H-vs-AMD-Ryzen-7-7800X3D-vs-AMD-Ryzen-9-6900HX) ) of different CPUs, I discarded the idea of some Intel N95/N97/N100/N150 chips. (The 7800X3D is my desktop PC CPU for reference)

I am an enthusiast in PCs, been building my own and friends desktops for years now. While my cmd-skills do rely on try and error with research instead of knowing everything, I do know how to navigate and change settings in a bios and that you should reinstall the whole OS on such a Chinese Mini PC - with a clean Windows Image from Microsoft itself.

I came across the following Mini PCs during my research:  
[Beelink EQR6 Mini PC, AMD Ryzen 5 6600U](https://www.amazon.de/Beelink-Computer-16-500-Bluetooth/dp/B0B4D9K7LM?ie=UTF8&th=1) for about 349€

All are with applied coupons.

So... Instead of talking about the Pros as they are all kinda equal, I rather emphasize the cons on those machines:  
Beelink EQR 6  
\- 6600U is the worst CPU  
\- No fully-functional USB-C in terms of third display (although I've read somewhere that it \*does\* support it)  
\- I assume it is single RAM usage in delivered state

GMKtec  
\- nothing to complain about despite it not having the best CPU of them all

ACEMAGIC M1  
\- well... the malware thing although it is resolvable with clean install but...  
\- no driver support on their website for this device  
\- best CPU for under 400€  
\- According to my findings, only has single RAM installed, making it hardly underperforming. New set of RAM with 32 GB will cost about 70€ so we get near the higher equipped EQR6

If it ever comes to gaming, I assume it might only have to run something like Emulation up to Gamecube / PS3 (if only lower possible, no problem) and as I have a fable, maybe a Hoyoverse game. Although from my research, the GPU won't be able to handle those.

So I was hoping to get some good advice which to choose from. 

If there is a better system in the same price range, feel free to recommend it. Although it should be available in Germany.

  
So - thank you for reading up to here and thanks in advance for any recommendations.",1,not_applicable
Musicians and Friends,"Being a musician (and founder) can be an incredibly lonely existence.

As a violinist for over 3 decades I've found making friends nearly impossible for most of my life. From practicing hours a day to become the best musician possible to finding communication with non-musicians difficult to painful, I've sought a better way to find friends for a very long time.

From the age of 10 through college, I was often the concertmaster of orchestras and that meant even further isolation due to either competitiveness, intimidation, or jealousy.

To add another layer to my loneliness, I've been a solo startup founder since the age of 19 and I had a policy of not befriending employees. At 30, I became a software developer and would often spend 80-100 hours per weeks programming. I also went through a 4.5 year divorce.

I'm one of the greatest inventors on our planet (invented Memorable) and I figured out how to solve one of the most important and painful problems we experience collectively as human beings: how to make friends in person for the rest of our life.

This is not a sales pitch as the company, Befriend, Inc. is registered as a nonprofit, our project is open source on Github, and what I'm developing is designed to be the antidote to decades of social disconnection, loneliness, and depression perpetuated through engagement-driven algorithms on platforms like Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, and even Reddit.

Befriend's purpose is for you and your kids to:

1. Never be without good friends
2. Never be stuck with friends for lack of better alternatives
3. Be able to make new friends as easily as ordering a ride share

You can personally solve this problem for the entire planet by helping Befriend execute a strategy for music artists to share the nonprofit platform with their fans as a way for them to be able to meet each other in person and real-time.

**In Person Matching**

a) We have a database of over 300k music artists aggregated from Music Brainz and populated with data from Spotify. [data.befriend.app/music/artists](https://data.befriend.app/music/artists)

b) Users can add their favorite music artists and rank them in the app

c) The app has a music artists filter where users can look for other users with a similar taste in music

d) Users can set a level of importance for each music artist filter (i.e. Taylor Swift - 9/10)

e) Our matching algorithm creates a score between each user based on a combination of this data

f) Our notification system sends notifications to users with the highest matching score first

**Musicians to Music Artists to Fans**

We are looking for musicians to help us spread our mission by reaching out to their personal favorite musicians to ask their fans and online followers to signup for the nonprofit Befriend app with the purpose of making friends with fellow fans in person and to finally solve this shared global problem once and for all!

Updated Rules and User Guidelines,"Hey everyone, it’s been a long time since I posted like this. To everyone new here, welcome to r/soulslikes! Since taking over, this sub has grown from a niche community where I interacted on *every* post, to one of the top 3% of communities of this kind on reddit, getting 3 million visitors each month. I am blown away by all your support, yet my intention of this subreddit still remains the same. To be a safe space for people to post and discuss their favourite genre.

With a community this size, we have recently begun receiving more feedback with regards to moderation decisions. In an effort to maximize fairness and consistency for our community, we have evaluated and updated the sub rules. 

These have been updated in the sidebar, and I will post additional commentary below them, to maximize transparency into the thinking behind these decisions. We believe this transparency is important, even as we remain realistic and understanding that opinions among individual community members may not always align completely. Post Flairs have been amended to account for some of these changes.  
  
The rules, effective immediately, are: 

***Rule 1: Posts Must Be Related to Soulslike/Soulslite Games***

* All games must have been either made by FromSoftware or be part of the soulslike/lite genre.
* Soulslikes are an evolving genre of game, and as such, decisions regarding individual games may at times be subject to mod discretion.
* Recommendations or discussion of games outside of the soulslike genre are allowed when the content is appropriately tied to the relevance of soulslike gaming and posted using appropriate flair.
* Posts seeking to engage primarily in political discussion are prohibited.



***Rule 2: Be Kind***

* *This rule encompasses and overshadows all others.*
* Insults and slurs will be removed and may result in a temporary or permanent ban.
* Conversation context will be considered, but user reports of posts or comments violating this rule will be addressed and considered seriously.
* Comment chains with multiple reports may be removed entirely. Don’t get caught up in arguments -- report the comment and allow the mods to handle it.



***Rule 3: No Low Effort Posts***

* *This rule encompasses and overshadows all others, bar Rule 2.*
* Posts must contain enough content to allow and encourage discussion and engagement between users.
* Game recommendation posts must include information such as games you have played in the past, what you enjoyed about them, and other detailed information to properly enable the community to assist you in a meaningful way. 
* Posts inciting discussion on a particular topic should make clear what the poster’s stance is on said topic.



***Rule 4: No Community Repetition***

* Redundant posts are subject to removal, we strongly encourage users to search and/or review recent posts before posting.
* Common sources of post repetition include, but are not limited to, game trailers, game opinions, choices between two games, etc.



***Rule 5: Provide Game Identification***

* Every post primarily focused on a particular game or games must identify the game(s) in the post title.



***Rule 6: Provide Spoiler Tags***

* During the first month following a game's launch, any relevant content posted from or about the game must have the spoiler tag enabled.
* Please err on the side of caution in this time period and utilize spoiler tags if at all in doubt.



***Rule 7: Meta Posts and Mod Interaction***

* Meta posts or comments regarding the subreddit itself, moderation decisions, or other non-soulslike topics at large, are prohibited.
* Moderators may make such meta posts at their discretion, and any comments or discussion in such threads are exempt from this rule.
* If you feel a meta topic of discussion is important or for any other reason need to communicate with the moderation team, please reach out to the moderators directly via modmail. DO NOT message individual moderators directly.



With the rules out of the way, here are some additional considerations and information pertaining to some of these rules that may help provide additional context:

**Regarding ""FromSoftware"" games being universally allowed:**

We have received comments that allowing content regarding all FromSoftware games to be posted allows for games like AC6, Kings Field & Nightreign to be discussed as well as other potential non-soulslike games. While this loophole exists, we believe the majority of the community agrees with the additional latitude we allow for FromSoftware titles as the company who birthed the genre. FromSoftware itself is hopelessly entwined with the definition and culture of soulslikes. Users still retain the power to upvote, downvote, or completely ignore any and all posts based on their own personal level of engagement with the given content.

**Regarding ""Non-Soulslike"" Games (or those that are debatably so):**  
  
As gamers, we are always looking for we think we would like and with soulslikes being so few and far between, we are happy (and encourage) users to discuss games you think soulslike fans will like, that are outside the genre (Claire 33 as a recent example). That said, these will be heavily monitored: They must be tagged correctly ('Not A Soulslike, But...') to set a reader’s expectations and the focus on the post must be why a soulslike fan will like the game. Due to the addition to the rule, the monthly stickied post will be removed going forward.

**Regarding ""Mod Discretion"" regarding ""what is or is not a soulslike"":**

This isn’t something that is taken lightly, but sometimes we only have users, trailers, steam tags and reviews to go off. We sadly cannot ensure that moderators will have sufficient coverage, time, or access to play every new game at launch. We will do our best to remain flexible as changes occur in and around the genre of soulslikes and will do our best to fairly evaluate games and content as these things occur. If you feel that there is any need to communicate disagreement with any of these decisions or to discuss specific meta-related discussions of a particular nature, please do no hesitate to reach out via modmail and we will address your request accordingly.

**Regarding ""Low Effort Posts"" and ""Game Recommendations"":**

The specific rule relating to game recommendation posts has been merged into our rule regarding low effort posts. The primary issue we as moderators, and you in the community, have historically raised regarding these posts ultimately all boil down to game recommendation posts that are otherwise also in violation of our low effort content rules. 

Furthermore, we recognize that the weekly ""Game Recommendations"" thread has not sufficiently worked to address this issue. Instead, we have added a new flair ('Game Recs') which must be used to easily identify the post, so people can choose to engage or not.

In an effort to prevent issues we have seen in the past regarding these type of posts dominating our front page content (particularly in low effort format), we feel we will be better able to address these underlying issues while still providing our community with a great resource to explore and discover new games to enjoy by requiring quality standards on game recommendation posts as well as requiring that such posts be sufficiently limited to avoid undue repetition.

Game recommendation posts will be monitored *heavily* and we will continue to evaluate these posts as a whole in an ongoing manner. As a warning to users, post  asking for game recommendations need to provide more context than simply “what should I play next?”, ""should I play X or Y?"", or ""is X worth playing?"". We want to maximally ensure our community is in a position to guide users to games they will genuinely enjoy and appreciate, but doing so requires sufficient effort on the part of the person seeking the recommendation, as well.

**Regarding ""Community Repetition"":**

We have reworked and reworded the prior ""no excessive posting"" rule. In the past, users have been frustrated if their post was removed when another similar post has been retained (this happens most frequently when numerous users post news or other timely announcements in a nearly simultaneous manner). While we appreciate the frustration when a post is removed, we also need to balance the needs of the community and we can best accomplish that by ensuring topics of discussion are centralized and not spread across multiple posts (particularly in short frames of time which additionally clutters up the front page). The new rule clarifies that posts will be judged against community-wide content, not just against your own prior posts.

One of the main purposes of this rule is to assist in managing game recommendations. Last year, we only had 8,000 members and 2/3rds of the front page was the exact same question, leaving content that was dull and users who were not interested in assisting. The engagement these posts get nowadays, when managed properly, is genuinely very high. As such, we want to continue allowing game recommendation posts, but also ensure the onus is on the poster to see if their question has been asked already (and to make sure the question has enough details to not trigger the ""Low Effort"" rule).

Reasonable exceptions will be ignored by the mods (e.g. we expect an increase of posts during a new launch and are happy to allow this). Please understand that our goal is not to stifle user posts or discussion, but to do our best to cultivate the best quality discussions we can facilitate.



**Final Thoughts**



Thank you for being a part of our community of soulslike gamers. We're excited about the growth we have seen both in our sub here, but also in the genre as whole. It's an exciting time to be a part of the soulslike community and there's no shortage of great games on the horizon. Take care!

"34"" OLED/QD-OLED Monitor for 80:20 productivity/gaming work - any suggestions?","I'm looking for a 1440p high refresh rate monitor that works for both gaming and productivity in the split I mentioned.

HDR looks dull and washed out in every game I've tried... (The new AOC Q27G40XMN),"I recently bought the new AOC Q27G40XMN (1440p, Mini-LED, VA). This is my first experience with HDR at all. As far as I'm aware, the only calibration I can do in the monitor settings as far as HDR goes is adjusting the HDR Mode (I assume this means preset), which includes: DisplayHDR, HDR Picture, HDR Movie, and HDR Game. While in HDR, the only other picture settings I can configure are contrast (from 0-100, which is unavailable in DisplayHDR mode) and local dimming settings (off, low, medium, high). From my testing on HDR youtube videos (namely this one: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxnMg0I0LZM&ab\_channel=TFTCentral](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxnMg0I0LZM&ab_channel=TFTCentral) ), the ""HDR Game"" preset (which is also the default mode) with local dimming set to ""low"" seems to be the best, as anything above low local dimming removes too many details in dark scenery. The video looks gorgeous in HDR! Super black darks, super bright highlights. However, I have tested these games in HDR (confirmed that my Windows settings say ""HDR on"", my monitor settings say ""HDR Game"" to on, the games' settings say HDR is on, and the games are all in fullscreen):

Red Dead Redemption 2

Monster Hunter Wilds

Dragon's Dogma 2

Baldur's Gate 3

All these games tested in ""HDR Game"" mode with local dimming on low, contrast on 55 (these are the only PC games I own with HDR settings so far). They all looked very grey, dull, washed out. Worse than SDR.  Some of these titles are salvageable with shaders, but others looks better or the same in SDR. I'm very confused if I am missing calibration settings in some form of software or if I have a faulty monitor. But the HDR videos look sexy so idk. I have tried Nvidia filters as other posts suggest, but every single one makes me crash almost instantly sooo (which is a shame, some of them I enjoy...) Thanks for any advice :>",1,software_external
Reviving Omnivore: Measuring interest in re-hosting and maintaining Omnivore,"Hi! 
A lot of Obsidian users here used Omnivore, a beloved read-it-later service that was killed rapidly in a private buy-out.

I'm a developer interested in taking over / forking omnivore and re-hosting it as a service. 

It looks like a group of people have continued development on the open source version, which is great for developers, but my interest would be in hosting this version for non-developers to use, as a service. 

My main interests would be in:
- making it available as a cloud service again
- charging $1-$4 dollars to cover server costs or accepting donations, ideally the first because donations are unpredictable
- improving it continuously and solidifying the codebase along with the current work people are doing
- keeping all of my contributions open source
- intentful bug tracking and feature requests for the hosted version
- improving data export and portability, and other hosting options, so in the extreme event that it were killed again - users would not be left hanging (maybe even icloud support as an *option*)

I made a mailing list and a poll if you're interested and want to follow along:
https://omnivorenext.substack.com

About me:
I am a seasoned developer who has worked on every part of the stack at FAANG companies, startups, mid sized companies. I hate big tech, private equity, and how poor quality software has become. I know how to run a full fledged large-scale service well and would have fun doing this as a sort of farm-to-table software project and labor of love (for omnivore and obsidian!).

Samsung Odyssey+ Owners! Was this Headset ALWAYS Blurry? Was It Ever Really Sharp/In-focus?,"I own a bunch of HMDs but have had a real love/hate relationship with my Samsung Odyssey+ over the years. Today I dusted it off and plugged it in to see how it holds up today and was dismayed at how blurry the image is compared to all my other headsets. Much blurrier than I remembered it being.

Now, if you search for this issue, you'll find many posts from users who claim the picture on their Odyssey headsets USED to be much sharper and that something--Steam VR, Windows, WMR itself--changed along the way to cause the image to become blurrier than it used to be. There are several different proposed solutions but none that seem to actually fix the issue for a majority of users--myself very much included.

I know Samsung used some sort of special filter on the panel designed to eliminate the screen door effect, and that this definitely caused a certain level of blurriness particularly with objects that were farther away, which would seem to suggest that this was in fact, always an issue ... but still in my own memory and the memory of other users, it seems to have gotten much worse at some point. There are numerous pro reviews still available to read on the web and I don't remember most of them noting an issue with blurriness this severe, but maybe they just ... ignored it? 

So my question is: did we all just IMAGINE that the Samsung Odyssey+ looked a lot sharper at some point in the past and it was ALWAYS this blurry?

Or did something actually change in the software chain at some point to make this flaw a lot worse?",1,software_external
"28 [M4F] UK - Fun, caring talkative introvert for the same?","Hi! I'm **Marc**. I'm **28**, and I live in **England**. I'm just putting my feelers out there to see if anybody is interested in me.

I'm just trying to get through life without too much chaos, while causing minimal harm :) I like occasional bits of silly fun - I'll grow up fully when I'm dead -, but I also know how to be serious - and life has not been suuuper kind to me these past few years, so I feel like a bit of an old man, even though I do not look like it. I'm definitely not a university student anymore - I can't relate to that mentality, do you understand me? I worked for 6 years after university in software development, but due to long-term illness I'm presently unemployed. I'm trying to get back into work, but I need to prioritise working on my health first. So I guess I'm a long-term investment, not a quick win :) Hence why I'm not on Tinder lol.

For certain, I don't 'want children', and I can't actually live with most pets. I just want a female partner. By all means stroke my head and call me a good boy if you want xD

I might be a giant nerd, but can I brag a little to offset that? I've been called 'cute' and 'handsome' by a number of women in the past :)) But am I your taste? Maybe - maybe not.

I'm not religious. I'm not very political - I have opinions of course, but I'm not an activist or whatever - at least not presently.

If you think I might make a good friend, or even a good boyfriend, feel free to take a chance on me :))

And if you're still not persuaded, then I wish you a good day or night, anyway!

First PC purchase,I’m a recently graduated engineering major who would like a desktop pc that could not only run CAD and FEA software but also be able to be used for gameplay. I would also like to attach a bamboo lab 3D printer in the future. What specs should I be looking for? This would be my first pc ever bought. I want it to last a good amount of time. What are some options for pre builds as well since I don’t really have time to build one? ,0,-
Randomly got a package in the mail,"So about half a year ago, I think in October, I got an update for my Galahad lcd AIO that killed the screen. 

The firmware the connect software tried to install didn’t play nice or something and since then I’ve had a dead lcd and have had to set the pump speed through the bios to get everything working. 

I had opened a support ticket trying to get some help and went through some troubleshooting steps with someone for about a week before communications just stopped. 
I attempted multiple emails afterwards as late as January with no reply so I had just given up. The AIO was working for its cooling purposes so it just didn’t look pretty anymore lol. 

Fast forward to today and I got a notice I had a package at my door. I open it and to my surprise it’s a Galahad 2 LCD..

After like 5 months of ghosting me Lian Li randomly sends me a replacement AIO. Searched my email and on Monday I had one from a Mike saying my request had been approved and dispatched and they sincerely apologize for the delay caused by a shortage of raw materials. 

So now I have a new AIO and no motivation to replace it atm lol",1,not_applicable
Is replacing employees with AI even economically possible?,"So, as of this day and age, it's becoming very apparent that some companies are slowly replacing individuals with AI. CEOs of these companies give long lectures (or e-mails in the case of Fiverr's CEO) about why AI employees are better, cheaper and ""more efficient"". And of course, there's no denying that a well-trained AI could do many things a lot better, which is even if you ignore the fact that AI is essentially just software and software can be improved substantially every day.  
  
However, if you look at the Industrial Revolution: it caused people to look for other types of jobs and created a lot of new jobs because someone needed to build, fix and operate those same machines. Now, with AI, we have essentially created an alternative to a human, so it is far different from a machine user in a manufacturing facility. The thing is, ultimately, the Industrial Revolution had a positive outcome for employees since many such jobs prior to machines were unhealthy and dangerous.  
But with AI, I don't think it can be like that. There have been two thoughts going through my head that make it seem like it is fundamentally impossible to have AI have all jobs.

1. If a CEO decides that having AI Agents is better and cheaper than having humans, then that only works if it remains small scale (i.e., only entry-level jobs or contractors). Why? If every CEO replaced all employees with AI, that would mean that eventually, none of these people that used to have jobs will be able to afford anything, let alone the product of that same CEO that just replaced *everything*. At the end of the day, economy is about people being able to afford things + companies being able to offer whatever a customer wants. By replacing all jobs with AI, wouldn't you completely destroy the economy as a whole?
2. On the flip side of that, the only reason why things cost money is because of... well... the fact that there are people who want to get rewarded for their efforts. However, if all of their jobs are replaced with AI as well, wouldn't that mean that at some point, all basic needs could be free?

I don't see a world where an economy could work if we, the (mostly) non-CEOs don't even have money to afford anything. Now, there is of course a discussion for a Universal Base Income (UBI) which would work for the small percentage that gets laid off before everything is essentially AI-based.

So, ultimately, assuming that my two points could be true, wouldn't AI be both the end of our economy as well as allowing us humans to just do whatever we want instead of having to work — so being extremely positive in the end? (Ignoring what the effect of not having to work could be.)",0,-

Advice on whether to take an SQL developer job.,"3 years experience (Web Development)
B.S. Comp Sci

Position Eliminated from last company in January. 

Ever since I got laid off or eliminated or whatever from my last job I’ve been looking for a new SWE role. I haven’t had a whole lot of luck. I’ve been shotgunning applications (around 2000). And been contacted by maybe 5-6 companies one of which I really liked and got to the final interview with last month and they went with someone with more experience in that particular stack. 

Here’s my dilemma I applied to an SQL developer job and I’ve had a few interviews and think I may get an offer. I also got contacted for another interview for a position at an org very closely associated with the one I had liked before but I expect their interview process to be very slow. So even if I got it I would have to make a decision on the SQL job first.

Would it be bad to take this SQL dev job assuming I get the offer? I’m torn because I don’t think I would enjoy the work as more development job. Additionally I’m scared my skills would suffer if I’m only using SQL and the companies other software they use. On the other hand it’s a job and the salary range is about 10k - 20k more than I made at my last job. It is also full remote which would be a bonus.

I’d appreciate any advice to help me think through this.

"1.5 Years of Unemployment: Lost, Learning and Looking for Direction","Hello everyone,

In this post, I want to share my 1.5 year period of unemployment, the mental challenges I faced and how I lost my direction. If you’re in a similar situation or have been through something like this before, please don’t leave without commenting. Your advice could be incredibly valuable to me.

I worked as a junior developer at a company for about 2.5 years. I was involved in a real-time object detection project written in C++, integrating Edge AI and IoT. Since it was a startup environment, there weren’t many employees so I had to deal with many different areas such as testing, benchmarking, profiler tools, CI/CD processes and documentation. Moreover, the senior developer (team lead) was unable to review my code or help to my technical growth due to the workload. Although I tried hard to improve and share what I learned with the team, I didn't receive the same level of feedback or collaboration in return.

After some time, the company decided to create its own Linux distribution using the Yocto Project. During this process, they had a deal with a consulting firm and I was tasked with supporting their work. Initially, I was responsible for defining the project requirements and communicating details about the necessary hardware, libraries, and tools. However, the consultancy was canceled shortly afterward, so I ended up handling the entire Yocto process alone. Then, I started learning Yocto, Linux and embedded systems on my own. I developed the necessary system structures for boards such as Raspberry Pi and NXP i.MX. The structure I developed is now used in thousands of devices in the field.

During my one-on-one meetings with the senior developer, I repeatedly expressed my desire to write more code and my need to improve my C++ skills. I also mentioned that I lacked an environment where I could grow. Each time, he told me we needed to finish the first version of the project (V1) and that he would help afterward. But as V1 turned into V1.1, then V1.2. 2.5 years passed and not much changed. During this time, I continued to improve my skills in the embedded Linux field on my own. In our final conversation, I told him that I was stuck technically and couldn’t make technical progress. He said there was nothing that could be done. At that point, I resigned because I couldn't take it anymore.

After resigning, I tried to improve myself in areas such as the Linux kernel, device drivers, U-Boot and DeviceTree. Although I had previously worked on configuring these topics but I hadn’t had the chance to write actual code for a real product.

Although I wasn’t good enough, I tried to contribute by working on open-source projects. I started actively contributing to the OpenEmbedded/Yocto community. I added Yocto support for some old boards and made others work with current versions. I worked on CVE, recipe updates and solving warnings/errors encountered in CI/CD processes.

I want to work on better projects and contribute more to the Linux kernel and Yocto. However, I struggle to contribute code because I have knowledge gaps in core areas such as C, C++, data structures and algorithms. While I have a wide range of knowledge, it is not deep enough.

Right now, I don’t know how to move forward. My mind is cluttered, and I’m not being productive. Not having someone to guide me makes things even harder. At 28 years old, I feel like I’m falling behind, and I feel like the time I’ve spent hasn’t been efficient. Despite having 2.5 years of work experience, I feel inadequate. I have so many gaps, and I’m mentally exhausted. I can’t make a proper plan for myself. I try to work, but I’m not sure if I’m being productive or doing the right things.

For the past 1.5 years, I’ve been applying and continue to apply for ""Embedded Linux Engineer"" positions but I haven’t received any positive responses. Some of my applications are focused on user-space C/C++ development and I think, I'm failing the interviews.

Here are some questions I have on my mind:

\- Is a 1.5–2 year gap a major disadvantage when looking for a job?

\- Is it possible to create a supportive environment instead of working alone? (I sent emails to nearly 100 developers contributing to the Linux kernel, expressing my willingness to volunteer in projects but I didn’t get any responses.)

\- What is the best strategy for overcoming my tendency to have knowledge in many areas but not in-depth understanding?

\- Which topics should I dive deeper into for the most benefit?

\- Am I making a mistake by focusing on multiple areas like C, C++, Yocto and the Linux kernel at the same time?

\- What kind of project ideas should I pursue that will both help me grow technically and increase my chances of finding a job?

\- Does my failure so far mean I’m just not good at software development?

\- I feel like I can’t do anything on my own. I struggle to make progress without a clear project or roadmap but I also can’t seem to create one. How can I break out of this cycle?

\- What’s the most important question I should be asking myself but haven’t yet?

Writing this feels like I’m pouring my heart out. I really feel lost. I want to move forward and find a way, but I don't know how. Advice from experienced people would mean a lot to me. Thank you for reading. I’m sorry for taking up your time. I hope I’ve been able to express myself clearly.

Is now a good time to get into car sales?,"I’ve been in sales for over a decade, mostly high end independent clothing stores where I made very good money; I would do over a million in sales in my sleep as it was a short sales cycle and I liked the business. 

Right now I’m in fine art selling at an art gallery and it’s awful due to inconsistency. Some months I’ll sell 175k, then nothing the next month, then the next month I’ll sell over 100k through financing, then crumbs for a few months, etc. I can make my whole month selling one piece, but last year that only happened on about five ups.

The cycle is longer but it’s also not the same as clothing, cars, or even watches because to me there’s less gratification of being seen *in* something and much less of a necessity as well. People may not need a Rolex or a 911 but those are areas where many people will buy what’s in their budget. People like to look at art but not necessarily pay to own it. 

I live very close to a car mall and have considered getting into car sales before. Theres a solid brand mix of luxury German, Toytoa, Honda, Subaru, Land Rover/Jag, and Porsche. Most of the higher tier brands command some car sales experience for applicants from what I’ve seen on Indeed, but I was thinking of getting into a volume store, especially if the pay plan is decent and I don’t have to work bell to bell. 

Tariffs, and unstable economy would usually mean hold onto what you have and stay put, but my savings is rapidly depleting and I will be in bad shape if I don’t turn things around very soon. I’m really not qualified for much else, and software sales or something similar would require me to relocate.

From Infrastructure to Influence: How Dacxi Chain Is Redefining the Power Structures of Global Capit,"https://preview.redd.it/ct62hhx7it0f1.png?width=1120&format=png&auto=webp&s=24ff2912c4b63a81d73c48bef037f37833f2f15d

The story of global equity crowdfunding is often told through the lens of regulation, democratization, and technology. But that story is incomplete. The real shift underway is structural — not just in how capital is raised, but in who controls the mechanisms of capital formation itself.

At the center of this shift is **Dacxi Chain**, not merely as a technological infrastructure, but as a **neutral, connective force that challenges the dominance of financial silos**. In the same way that open-source protocols disrupted proprietary software models, Dacxi Chain is quietly redrawing the map of capital flow — and with it, the global balance of economic opportunity.

# The Hidden Politics of Capital Access

Despite the rhetoric of globalization, capital remains stubbornly local. Gatekeepers — from regulators to institutional networks — still shape who gets funded and who gets left behind. The irony? In a digital-first world, a founder in Lagos can build a product for users in London, but may never get funded by investors in either.

That’s not a technology gap. It’s a structural one.

Dacxi Chain flips this equation by introducing a **shared protocol layer** that links national crowdfunding platforms into a **collaborative global marketplace**. But more importantly, it reconfigures power:

* **Platforms become nodes in a network, not islands**
* **Investors gain access to global deal flow, not just local pipelines**
* **Regulatory compliance becomes programmable, not prohibitive**

This is not a minor efficiency upgrade. It’s a reengineering of how economic influence is distributed.

# Capital Without Borders. Influence Without Bias.

In traditional systems, capital follows influence. Dacxi Chain reverses this. By embedding trust, identity, and compliance into its fabric, it allows capital to flow on the merit of the opportunity — not on the location of the founder or the connections of the lead investor.

Consider what that unlocks:

* A climate-tech startup in Indonesia can raise from retail investors in Germany and institutional backers in Canada.
* Diaspora communities can invest in local innovation without friction.
* Regulators can approve participation based on shared standards rather than reinventing oversight jurisdiction by jurisdiction.

This is more than financial plumbing. It’s a **redistribution of influence**, empowering regions, people, and platforms that have historically been excluded from early-stage investing.

# The Network Is the Market

Dacxi Chain’s most radical idea isn’t technical. It’s economic: **that the future market for private equity will be defined by the networks that distribute it — not the institutions that guard it.**

In this model:

* Trust isn’t brokered, it’s embedded
* Verification isn’t paper-based, it’s interoperable
* Governance isn’t an afterthought, it’s automated

In effect, Dacxi Chain doesn’t just make equity crowdfunding borderless — it makes it **platformless**. Any regulated local platform plugged into the network gains access to global liquidity, reputation systems, governance tooling, and investor networks — while retaining sovereignty over their own deals and community.

This is a far cry from the top-down models of fintech expansion. It’s **bottom-up globalization** — one where innovation travels through protocol, not power.

# The Future Is Federated

As global capital markets evolve, centralization is no longer the endgame. What’s emerging instead is a federated model of trust and access — one where infrastructure is shared, but relationships are local; where platforms co-own rather than compete for distribution.

Dacxi Chain, in this light, isn’t a product. It’s a **paradigm**. It replaces friction with federation. And in doing so, it offers a rare thing in global finance: **a protocol that empowers without colonizing**.

# A Call to Builders, Not Just Investors

If the internet age taught us anything, it’s that the systems we build define the futures we get. Dacxi Chain represents an opportunity — not just for investment, but for participation in the design of a new capital market.

It invites local platforms to link up, regulators to lean in, and investors to look beyond borders. Not in search of the next unicorn, but in service of a global economy that allocates capital based on **potential, not privilege**.",0,-

Initially,  I was responsible for defining the project requirements and communicating details about the necessary hardware, libraries, and tools. However, the consultancy was canceled shortly afterward, so I ended up handling the entire Yocto process alone. Then, I started learning Yocto, Linux and embedded systems on my own. I developed the necessary system structures for boards such as  Raspberry Pi and NXP i.MX. The structure I developed is now used in thousands of devices in the field.

During my one-on-one meetings with the senior developer, I repeatedly expressed my desire to write more code and my need to improve my C++ skills. I also mentioned that I lacked an environment where I could grow. Each time, he told me we needed to finish the first version of the project (V1) and that he would help afterward. But as V1 turned into V1.1, then V1.2. 2.5 years passed and not much changed. During this time, I continued to improve my skills in the embedded Linux field on my own. In our final conversation, I told him that I was stuck technically and couldn’t make technical progress. He said there was nothing that could be done. At that point, I resigned because I couldn't take it anymore.

After resigning, I tried to improve myself in areas such as the Linux kernel, device drivers, U-Boot and DeviceTree. Although I had previously worked on configuring these topics but I hadn’t had the chance to write actual code for a real product.

Although I wasn’t good enough, I tried to contribute by working on open-source projects. I started actively contributing to the OpenEmbedded/Yocto community. I added Yocto support for some old boards and made others work with current versions. I worked on CVE, recipe updates and solving warnings/errors encountered in CI/CD processes.

I want to work on better projects and contribute more to the Linux kernel and Yocto. However, I struggle to contribute code because I have knowledge gaps in core areas such as C, C++, data structures and algorithms. While I have a wide range of knowledge, it is not deep enough.

Right now, I don’t know how to move forward. My mind is cluttered, and I’m not being productive. Not having someone to guide me makes things even harder. At 28 years old, I feel like I’m falling behind, and I feel like the time I’ve spent hasn’t been efficient. Despite having 2.5 years of work experience, I feel inadequate. I have so many gaps, and I’m mentally exhausted. I can’t make a proper plan for myself. I try to work, but I’m not sure if I’m being productive or doing the right things.

For the past 1.5 years, I’ve been applying and continue to apply for ""Embedded Linux Engineer"" positions but I haven’t received any positive responses. Some of my applications are focused on user-space C/C++ development and I think, I'm failing the interviews.

Here are some questions I have on my mind:

\- Is a 1.5–2 year gap a major disadvantage when looking for a job?

\- Is it possible to create a supportive environment instead of working alone? (I sent emails to nearly 100 developers contributing to the Linux kernel, expressing my willingness to volunteer in projects but I didn’t get any responses.)

\- What is the best strategy for overcoming my tendency to have knowledge in many areas but not in-depth understanding?

\- Which topics should I dive deeper into for the most benefit?

\- Am I making a mistake by focusing on multiple areas like C, C++, Yocto and the Linux kernel at the same time?

\- What kind of project ideas should I pursue that will both help me grow technically and increase my chances of finding a job?

\- Does my failure so far mean I’m just not good at software development?

\- I feel like I can’t do anything on my own. I struggle to make progress without a clear project or roadmap but I also can’t seem to create one. How can I break out of this cycle?

\- What’s the most important question I should be asking myself but haven’t yet?

Writing this feels like I’m pouring my heart out. I really feel lost. I want to move forward and find a way, but I don't know how. Advice from experienced people would mean a lot to me. Thank you for reading. I’m sorry for taking up your time. I hope I’ve been able to express myself clearly.

Note: I haven’t been able to do anything for the past five months and have been in deep depression. However, I applied to the “Linux Kernel Bug Fixing Summer” program hoping it would help me and it looks like I will most likely be accepted.",1,unknown

There’s a product backlog attached to the scrum board which gets updated and refined and the few days before new sprint starts we pick upcoming sprints goals from the backlog 


There are also a lot of requests that come randomly from clients, some that need to be done during active sprint, some that can go through the backlog. For some items we need PRDs or heavy UI/UX input before handing to dev. 

I’m not sure what the best way to organize this would be since I’m new to Jira as well

I’m thinking the scrum board continues to be managed by the Tech lead

Is this insane micromanaging? (rant),"Can I just check if I'm being crazy here, or if this is just normal, as I feel like I'm being gaslit by my boss here.

So I'm a senior software developer, I work for a software house, and am currently working on a project that I started 1 year ago from the first initial commit, to now where it is grossing £3.5m per year, and we haven't even really gotten started yet with scaling customers, so that number can scale a lot higher. We started selling the service just 2 months ago. As we're now making bank, the boss is taking more if a leading role in this project and is starting to pay more attention to it.

I am the sole dev on this project. I do front end, back end, DevOps, infrastructure, support, tests, documentation, project management, product ownership, the whole shebang. Literally everything you can conceive as a functional product in this business was built by my own hands, while our client handles the business side of things himself. I work frankly a ridiculous amount of hours, and am on call 24/7. (We did hire a dev a few weeks ago, but he has yet to contribute anything and is still learning the code base, he does seem to know his shit)

And to be clear, *I'm fine with this.* I get paid well. So it's worth sacrificing my life for this, and putting up with the bullshit that comes with this arrangement for at least a few years until I have enough money to have options.

However, this morning my boss rings me up and rants at me for not working correctly. He says, every unit of code I write from now on should be its own commit, and attached to its own work item on azure devops that is itself documented, and discussed with management beforehand. Every single unit of code. He is mad because, as a solo dev, I don't really have any need to commit very often. I'm not collaborating with anybody. so I usually commit full features. I.e, if there is a button that does a thing, I usually submit the front end, backend, and infrastructure requirements of that button as a single commit when its done. Which are themselves behind feature flags. He also wants to be able to see a daily progression of commits so we can have daily stand-ups to discuss the work I'm doing. He doesn't want me committing once per week with a big feature, because the volume of code I'm writing overwhelms him, and he can't be bothered to look over it at all (my code is also diligently commented, so it's obvious what everything is doing). So he's demanding I change my workflow, and day and structure it around a daily stand-up to make sure boxes are checked, and agile work items are linked together and documented instead of delivering... well, quite literally millions in value to our client.

That's insane, right? What do I do here...? Or am I being unreasonable? My boss is extremely stubborn, and always falls back to ""I've got x decades of experience in software, you don't, I know what's best"", when in reality his code is stoned college junior level, he's just a business man that manages companies. I feel like this is a totally wild expectation lumped on top of an already wild expectation that I be *every* tech department in this business. I don't really want to leave, the client and I have a super good relationship, and my options are superb. What I can I do to explain to him that helicoptering in occasionally and demanding I change my entire workflow is not the play? I feel like this will 3x any development time I have because I'll constantly be compartmentalizing work, and managing work items and documentation of each work item nobody is ever going to read in a thousand years.

New job requires to pay for invoicing. Can I opt out?,"So I have just started work for a delivery company as a self employed driver. 

After the whole process and getting the job, I was told I would have to use an invoice app to invoice the company. The invoicing costs £12.50 a week! £50 a month! Thats more than minimum wage and would take over 4 hours to pay for so bascially I am working the first 4 hours of a week for free to pay some company to allow me to have my wage.

I am already not in a great place just now and looking for temporary work and this just feels like another poor tax. Absolutely hate this.

The International EPD System selling licenses to consultancies?,"Does anyone have a list of who the consultancies are that purchased licenses to operate the different regions from the International EPD System?  Looking on their website (https://www.environdec.com/global-network/regional-partners), it's not obvious at all who these organizations are.

Asking since I'm just noticing that the North American licensee is WAP Sustainability, and many of the International EPD System's EPD for this region are also either by WAP Sustainability or using their EPD tool Theta.  These EPDs shouldn't be marketed as type III (i.e. third party verified), since they don't meet the ISO 14025 requirements due to the program operator (WAP Sustainability) is also the consultant performing the EPD, the data/software provider, and also hand picking the verifiers.  This is similar to the EPD Hub, who are operated by OneClick who also provides the data/software and selects the verified.

Too bad the International EPD System is selling out like this, they used to be looked at as a leader in the EPD field.",1,not_applicable
Using Simulink + Embedded Coder with ZCU106 (Zynq Ultrascale+ MPSoC) – Do I Need Vitis for ARM Targets?,"Hi all,

I'm starting out with the ZCU106 evaluation board (Zynq Ultrascale+ MPSoC) and looking to use a model-based design approach with Simulink and Embedded Coder — targeting the ARM cores only (Cortex-A53 or R5).

My initial goal is simple: build a basic “Hello World” app, like toggling an LED via GPIO, using auto-generated C code from Simulink.

I’m not planning to touch the PL/FPGA fabric (at least for now), so ideally I’d like to avoid VHDL/HDL workflows entirely.

That said, I’m finding it unclear what’s actually required to get this flow working:

* Do I need to install Xilinx Vitis (or SDK) to deploy code to the ARM cores, or can Simulink + Embedded Coder handle this directly?
* Is Vitis Model Composer required for basic GPIO access, or is that only necessary when targeting the PL?
* Is this board even well supported for this kind of Simulink-based embedded development, or am I better off using a different Zynq board for a smoother experience?

If anyone has experience using Simulink with ZCU106 (or similar Zynq Ultrascale+ boards) purely on the embedded software side, I’d really appreciate your insights. Especially interested in knowing which add-ons/tools are *actually* needed to go from model to running code.

Vevor Smart 1 alternative software.,"I can't POSSIBLY be the only person that thinks the software Vevor includes with the Smart1 cutter is barely functional if not downright infuriating.

And their licensing limitations are enough to tick off the pope...

I ran into a need for a 2nd install, one for my laptop, and one for my desktop.  (that way I can plug my laptop into the docking station / KVM and just print and cut without having to move files around, but no Exact Cut can't be bought separately, and I have no need for a 2nd machine, which has been out of stock for a while, perhaps discontinued I don't know... Hopefully not. I actually like the machine, it is the software that blows chunks.

Anyway I found that Easy Cut Studio 6 has added support for the Vevor Smart1. [https://www.easycutstudio.com/](https://www.easycutstudio.com/)  If you look at their compatibility matrix, which is HUGE, so use the find function in your browser for Smart and you will find it quick...

License isn't terribly costly and it is a perpetual license, no stupid subscription to the software... 

I have it installed in my desktop and need to dive deep into it, but for now, looks good so far.

Hopefully this helps someone else out.

Temp + Humidity Sensor for Horse Blankets using LoRa. Can I build this with minimal engineering experience?,"Hi everyone! I'm trying to make a prototype for a simple, rugged temperature + humidity sensor that attaches to a horse blanket to monitor comfort and overheating. So far what makes the most sense is transmitting data via LoRa to a gateway nearby. I want to log temps throughout the day and check them remotely.

The long term goal is to basically have an ecobee type setup but for a horse's temperature. Sensor, Gateway, App that alerts you if your horse is too hot/humid.

I have very little electronics experience, but I'm comfortable learning and tinkering. Here's what I’ve gathered so far that I might need:

Sensor Node (on the blanket):

* XIAO ESP32S3 or XIAO nRF52840
* Wio-E5 / Wio-SX1262 module (for LoRa)
* Sensirion sensor for temp + humidity
* Small battery (but I need a safe solution for horses laying/rolling. No blanket fires)
* Protoboard, wires, safe casing

Gateway:

* Something like a RAKwireless LoRa gateway or ESP32 with LoRa module near the barn

Software: 

* Arduino IDE
* Something for alerts/notifs. Meshtastic???
* Mobile app/dashboard

My main goals:

* Keep it compact and rugged (horses roll, lie down, etc.)
* Transmit readings every 30-60 minutes
* Looooong battery life.. Weeks?
* Avoid overcomplicating with too much engineering or surface-mount work to start off

Questions:

1. Is this realistic for a beginner with basic Arduino and soldering knowledge?
2. Is the XIAO + Wio combo a good choice? Or would an all in one board be smarter?
3. Any battery/power suggestions that are horse safe and fit in a small case?
4. Am I missing anything big from this build?

Would love any thoughts, sanity checks, or advice. I'm just looking to have a prototype ready before the winter. It doesn't have to be high tech by any means. Just record temp data inside the blanket and transmit it somewhere so I can read it. Once I figure out it's even possible I can complicate it then.

Entry Level Roles Are A Dime A Dozen,"I’ve noticed how brutal the entry-level developer job market is, there are barely any entry level positions, every role you find is swamped with 200+ applicants, and you hear crickets after sending your resume on LinkedIn or Indeed.

I felt that frustration a few months ago, until I switched to a three-step playbook that got me a couple more interviews in just two weeks: first, stop applying everywhere and laser-focus on the few entry-level roles that actually match your skills—whether that’s JavaScript frameworks or basic SQL etc... I like to use revers search google method:

site:jobs.lever.co ""software developer""  apply.workable.com ""software developer "" jobs.ashbyhq.com ""software developer"" boards.greenhouse.io ""software developer""

Just change the job title to whatever you're looking for. Then on Google, click “Tools” and set the date filter to “Past week”. That way, you’re only seeing jobs that were just posted for this.  This should help you find more entry level roles.

I highly recommend taking an additional step further and finding out the recruiter or ""talent acquisition specialist"" of each job listing on linkedIN and reaching out to them via email or cold dm'. I use the tool getprospect for that.

This is a lot of extra steps just to get your application seen but that's the job market now and that's what you gotta do. I got tired of doing this and built a system that automates a lot of it, let me know if that works.",1,software_external

Cursor's ban of Indian students have wide reaching consequences,"What’s happening with the Cursor ban isn’t just about one app—it’s a reflection of a deeper, more uncomfortable truth that’s starting to catch up with us. We love calling ourselves a tech superpower, we keep saying India is leading the charge in AI and software, but actions like this quietly tell a different story. When a promising AI tool like Cursor, used by developers and students worldwide, suddenly starts blocking Indian users—especially students—without any explanation, it hits differently. It chips away at something bigger than just access. It chips away at belief. At competitiveness. At our future.

Because while we’re being locked out, students in other parts of the world—some barely in high school—are already integrating these tools into their learning. They’re writing better code, faster. They’re building AI-native workflows, experimenting, launching side projects, and becoming future-ready. And on the other side, you have Indian students—just as talented, just as hungry—forced to scavenge for offline alternatives or patchy workarounds because Cursor now sees an Indian IP as a risk, not a contributor. The tragic part? It’s not because of a lack of talent. It’s not even about infrastructure. It’s about trust. And that trust is something we, as a community, have slowly eroded.

Let’s be brutally honest with ourselves—how many times have we seen Telegram groups sharing “free methods” to get premium software? Fake .edu emails, VPNs to spoof regions, creating disposable accounts just to milk a trial plan. We call it “jugaad” like it’s clever. But to the people building these tools, it looks like abuse. And when enough of that comes from one region, it’s easier to block than to fix. The cost of that blunt decision, though, falls on everyone—including the honest ones. The aspiring student in tier-2 India trying to build something new. The college kid burning midnight oil on a project. The curious teen learning to code for the first time. They’re all being denied access to the same tools their peers abroad are freely using—not because they did anything wrong, but because someone else did. And the worst part? We’re getting used to it.

Imagine a 19-year-old in Germany building production-ready apps with Cursor’s AI pair programming, while her counterpart in India is stuck fiddling with old-school setups, constantly being told: ""this feature isn’t available in your region."" That’s how the gap begins—not with big headlines or economic shifts, but with small, repeated exclusions. One tool. One ban. One lost opportunity at a time. And if we keep going like this, we’re not just missing out on cool features—we’re locking ourselves out of the future.

This isn’t just about Cursor. It’s about our identity in the global tech world. Do we want to be known as innovators, or as a region companies quietly restrict? We have the numbers, the intelligence, the drive—but we also need accountability. If we don’t start calling out this culture of exploiting every system until it breaks, we’re going to keep losing access, and worse—respect. It’s not too late to change that. But it starts with us. With how we behave, how we educate each other, and how we treat the tools that shape our tomorrow.

Because if we don’t fix this, we’ll keep waking up to more silent bans, more locked features, and a world that keeps moving forward—without us.

I’ll be finishing my MHA this December. Lately, I’ve started looking at job postings that interest me, but it’s been tough to find something I’m qualified for without taking a big pay cut.

Over the years at Children’s, I’ve worked as an ophthalmic technician and was promoted three years ago to an ophthalmic educator. In that role, I handle onboarding, training, interviewing, policy alignment, and performance management—though I don’t technically have direct reports. I’ve also done clinical scheduling and a lot of hands-on patient care, but I’m ready to move away from anything patient-facing.

I’m really interested in roles related to project management, operations, or data analytics, but I don’t have certifications or experience in those areas. I’d love to get into that kind of work, but I'm feeling unqualified without any experience or knowledge of specific data/project software. I think I could get a clinical management position but this isn't what I'm looking for. Ayn recommendations on roles I should look for? Are there any easier project/data certifications that would help me break into the hospital administration field? ",1,not_applicable
"Opportunity in sales, how much would it change future opportunities?","Hello Everyone,

I have been on this sub a little while but decided to make a throwaway account to ask for some advice on an opportunity that was recently presented to me.

I graduated college exactly 1 year ago and have worked as a consultant for a software company since then. I’ve realized I am not overly thrilled about this type of work/industry but feel as if I am compensated greatly and have low stress overall which I am grateful for. I have had reservations for a while now as I had to relocate far from family/friends, move to a city I don’t like all that much, and have a feeling of existential dread when reflecting on life in the corporate world. However, I see those around me being given great opportunities when they move on from a role like mine. Top MBA/Masters programs, lucrative roles at startups, and more traditional roles in tech. As a result my working plan was to spend the next 5-6 years in my current company or consulting/tech generally (not sales) and then shoot for a top MBA program. If accepted, I’d like to take my chances as a professional/semi-professional poker player before and while in school as this is one of my passions. This additional education would come with the hopes of working in Management Consulting post-grad and or other more traditional post-MBA routes.

Recently an opportunity that interests me has come up but has also made me second guess my plans. A fully remote Account Representative role for a software company. The base pay is about $17k lower than my current role but with estimated commission of $30k-$50k. I have never done anything sales related and am concerned that I may have trouble leaving the sales world if I ever choose to do so. Do people end up siloed in this line of work or are there opportunities to pivot elsewhere if it doesn’t work out? My main concern is that while this immediately might be an improvement compensation and lifestyle wise, it could be a hinderance to opportunities in the future. Just looking for some advice on the world of sales and exits if I hate it? Also, does the lifestyle feel vastly different than say a data analyst at a large company or another business function that is typically 9-5?",1,not_applicable
Bangalore vs Berlin: Evaluating a tough choice between two solid offers 🇮🇳🇩🇪,"Hey everyone,

I’m a software engineer with approx 2.5 YOE trying to decide between two strong offers, but I’m struggling to evaluate them holistically — factoring in compensation, location, family life, and long-term growth. Would love your thoughts!

**Offer 1: Company A (Unicorn Startup – Bangalore, India)**

* **Role: SDE-2**
* **Compensation:** ₹30L fixed + ₹18L in stocks (4-year vesting)
* **Perks:** Indian startup with fast-paced growth, significant ownership in product
* **Family:** Easier to manage family support, no relocation stress

**Offer 2: Company B (FAANG – Berlin, Germany)**  
*(Already have this company on my resume)*

* **Role: SDE-1**
* **Compensation:** €68K fixed + €14K annual bonus + \~€1.8K in first-year stocks
* **Relocation Package:** €7K
* **Culture:** Better work-life balance, structured hours, global exposure

**My Dilemma:**  
I already hold the FAANG tag and have a relatively good standing. The Berlin offer looks attractive on paper for lifestyle and global experience, but the *salary isn’t a major upgrade*, especially when adjusted for cost of living and family expenses in Germany. Plus, I’ll have to relocate and figure out things from scratch. **I do not have a clear picture of how much will be my monthly expenses and will I be able to save enough, so please give me a brief idea about that?**

On the other hand, the Bangalore startup offer is aggressive in comp, offers me more financial growth (especially in INR), and allows me to stay close to family — which matters to me.

What would you prioritize in this case? Should I go for the international exposure and better WLB, or stick to the higher PPP-adjusted package in India with family stability?

"Have experience in software engineering and equipment validation, what roles can I apply to?","Hello,

I have a little over 2 years of experience as a fullstack software engineer as well as \~5 years of experience working as a validation specialist/engineer for medical device / biotech companies, specializing in equipment validation. 

For context, I did a bootcamp to career change into software engineering with a degree in chemical engineering. Currently unemployed since January

After some time thinking, it might be best for me to move on from continuing to be a software engineer and look into different roles. I would love to continue to work with technology in some capacity if possible. I have also thought about going back to my previous role.

I wanted to ask for some advice on what roles I can look into that could use both of my experiences here? From roles I've researched, a lot of them require years of experience where I don't think i have much relevant experience.

Problem with Plustek scanner (or my lack of knowledge),"I wanted to dust off my hobby of film photography and went ahead to scan my first roll of film in a while. I have a Plustek 7200i scanner with the original SilverFast SE software for Windows.

A while ago, when I did my first scans, I would scan the film as negative and use the SilverFast software to do inversion for me and some preprocessing before editing the image in GIMP, but I was always a bit disappointed with the results.

This time I wanted to do everything by myself, so I set the scanner into positive-scanning mode, kept everything standard in the SilverFast software to do as little processing to the scan as possible and to just get the ""raw"" negative scanned (screenshot).

I did my scan, exported to rawTherapee, sampled white balance from the border (unexposed film) making it pretty much perfectly balanced RGB and exported that to GIMP. In GIMP I inverted the image and got the resulting image attatched. Mostly the white balance is good, but the reds are WAAAY off.

I sometimes have this impression that the silverfast software is unconsistent in its scans - I scan one image and then another one and they look like they were scanned with completely different settings. I change the settings, bring them back to where they were and it gives me a different looking image on the same settings!

Did anyone have this kind of problem? Am I doing something wrong? Is it the scanning software issue? Is it a hardware issue? Is it a (sobs) skill issue? Please help, how should I approach this?

Does leaving High paying job in India and moving to Germany worth it?,"Hey folks,

I’m currently working in India, earning around 22 LPA with 4 years of experience. My fiancée is also working and earning 30 LPA. We've been thinking about moving to Germany for a Master's in AI/ML Engineering, Computer science or Data Science, and we’d likely go together.

I’m genuinely interested in the field and keen to explore opportunities in Europe. However, I’m unsure whether it’s the right move financially and career-wise. We'd be giving up decent-paying jobs in India and spending 2 years studying, possibly working part-time during that period. Post-master’s, how would the situation look like?

Would love to hear your thoughts — especially from folks who’ve made a similar move or are working in AI/ML or software engineer in Germany.

Is it a good decision in the long run? Or should we continue in India where we already have stable careers?

my_qualifications and his: Btech in Computer science with 4 years of work experience 

I can learn German more in 2 years I have A1 right now.

"Men of Reddit, what do you think is the best way to control your short temper and be wise?","Hey everyone. I request that all of you advise me on my situation and this would really change my life and I am really loojing to get better. I’m eager to make some positive changes and hope to hear your thoughts on navigating my current situation.

Allow me to introduce myself. I'm a 35M and I've spent the past 12 years as a software developer. I’m fortunate to be in a field that not only offers me a comfortable income but also allows me to channel my passion for technology and I WFH. My wife who works in a similar role within our industry also earns a good salary which contributes to our stable financial situation and she WFH too. Together we’re raising our energetic 3 year old son who brings joy and laughter to our lives every day.

I pride myself on my friendly nature. I’m always willing to lend a hand and support those around me especially when I notice someone in distress. I find it hard to witness others in pain as empathy is something I hold dear. Seeing someone in distress or pain deeply affects me. I cannot bear to witness sadness. In fact when I encounter situations where someone is bleeding or injured, I often feel overwhelmed and faint, a testament to my sensitivity. 

My family is my top priority and I dedicate a significant amount of my time and affection to them. I consciously choose to avoid spending money on frivolous items and instead focus on saving for my family's future especially for my son. Over the past few years I have worked tirelessly and diligently resulting in the successful payoff of a $500k mortgage. A milestone that brings me immense pride. At my core I am a family-oriented individual and I have very few friends. Only one or two have become more like family over the years. My greatest aspiration is to witness my loved ones flourish remaining healthy and happy as they navigate life. It brings me joy to invest in their well being and create an environment filled with love and support.

My main concern is my short temper. I get angry easily even over small things and it's making my life miserable. In those moments of anger I feel like I forget all my principles and afterward I regret my actions and feel filled with guilt. Sometimes things that won't matter in an hour drive me crazy leading to debates with my wife, mother, and brother who are everything to me. I feel guilty almost immediately within just five minutes of getting angry. This pattern happens every time. I get angry, say harsh words, and then shortly after I realize my mistakes and feel like a bad person for treating them poorly even though the damage has already been done. This is starting to impact my mental health. I genuinely want to show love and care to everyone around me and I don’t want to get angry but I seem unable to help it. I know that if I can control my short temper, I will become a better person and people will look up to me.

To clarify what I have done so far. I have visited a therapist several times and during our sessions I show no signs of anger. However when I am at home, if something hurts my ego or if someone tries to correct me, debate with me, or present a point that undermines mine, I can become extremely angry. If someone shows off in front of me or if I feel disrespected, I often lose control and react with anger. I usually feel bad about it within five minutes and apologize afterward. I have also participated in focus groups but the same pattern occurs. I manage to remain calm during the sessions but in the heat of the moment I forget everything and again react with rage. Recently I have been trying to listen to podcasts at a low volume through earbuds whenever I am around others. When I feel anger rising instead of reacting, I focus on the podcast, asking myself if this moment will matter to me in an hour. This helps me cool off. Additionally, when I'm overwhelmed with rage, I think about the possibility of someone dying at that moment and how I would regret letting my anger consume me. This thought often transforms my anger into a sense of love which helps but it's still difficult. Despite my efforts I continue to make mistakes. While these strategies help to some extent they don’t last long.

I am not sure what should I do? Help your brother here and I am willing to try everything I can. 

How can I be a person who is anger free and wise?",1,unknown
I Built CatDoes: Your Words to Native Apps,"# What is CatDoes?

[https://catdoes.com](https://catdoes.com) is a no-code AI app builder that transforms conversations into fully functional **native** mobile apps. You simply describe your app idea, and AI agents handle everything else from understanding the app's requirements to releasing on the app stores.

# How does it work?

CatDoes uses four specialized AI agents working together:

1. **Requirement Agent**: Understands your app's requirements and what features it needs, then passes it to the design agent.
2. **Design Agent**: Comes up with an appropriate user flow, what pages the app needs and how these pages interact with each other, along with an appropriate color palette for your app.
3. **Software Agent**: Knows how to code, and from the information that it has received from the first two agents, it starts building the app for you.
4. **Release Agent**: Prepares your app for releasing on Google Play and Apple's App Store. It's all conversational!

# Who is this for?

* **SMBs** looking to expand their digital presence
* **Startup founders** who need to quickly build an MVP and gather user feedback
* **UI/UX designers** wanting functional prototypes of their designs
* **Non-technical entrepreneurs** with app ideas but no coding skills
* **Anyone** for their specific needs(Personal apps)

# What makes CatDoes different?

Our platform is quite easy to use. Everything's conversational. Everyone who can type can make an app!

We're not focusing on one-shotting an app. We want to have a platform that allows you to maintain your app as well. Think you want to add a new feature down the road, or there's a new Android/iOS release and you want to make sure your app works fine with the new OS updates.

We have easy-to-use checkpoints called ""instances."" They're your conversation history + commit in one package. You start a new checkpoint, shape your app further, and if you don't like the outcome, you can roll back. Instances are stacked on top of each other. Meaning, the second instance is the continuation of the first instance.

# We've launched and we'd love to hear your feedback!

We're still refining our product and would love to hear your thoughts. What app would you build if coding wasn't an issue? Any features you'd want to see? I'm around to answer questions and would love your honest thoughts! Feel free to ask questions in the comments or DM me directly!

P.S. If you know anyone who's been sitting on an app idea, maybe tag them? I'd love to help more people build their ideas!",0,-
"Ajazz AK992 (no leds v.) works via bluetooth, wired but not via 2.4ghz","I have a Ajazz AK992 no lights version and it' currently working via bluetooth and wired, but not via dongle.  
Some time ago I was using my keyboard via 2.4 ghz and all of a sudden the 2.4ghz mode light started blinking and even if I resetted the keyboard on factory default (fn+spacebar for 3 secs) or resetted the 2.4ghz connection (fn+r for 5 seconds to make it blink faster and enter on pairing mode) the keyboard doesn't connect on the dongle 2.4.  
  
Other thing that looks strange is that it repairs well on another notebook I have when I do fn + R, and after I repair it with the dongle on the notebook and move the dongle to my pc, it works for like 5 minutes and then it starts to blink again as if lost the connection.   
  
I don't know how to fix the issue since the software for this specific version of ajazz's keyboard is sh\*\*, the manuals on the internet covers so little for the version with no lights or it brings wrong infos.

Potential Match for Woodbury John Doe,"I have already submitted the match to the doe network, however I was curious to see what other people thought while I wait for further updates from them. 

Woodbury Doe
https://www.doenetwork.org/cases/software/main.html?id=218umny 

William Walter Brooks, Jr.
https://www.doenetwork.org/cases/software/mp-main.html?id=364dmmd

Woodbury Doe was found in New York in 1998, but was estimated to have died between 1988-1993. William went missing in 1992, and according to his profile on the charley project’s website he may have traveled to New York after his disappearance. Both are the same race, William (17 years old) fits within the Doe’s age estimate(17-35), and both appear to be visually similar based on the Doe’s reconstructions, even the one that appears to depict the Doe on the higher end of the age range (on their doe network profiles) looks similar to William’s age progression. Both also have several tooth fillings. 

I also noticed that one eye on the Doe’s reconstruction looks very slightly higher than the other. When looking back at William’s photo I believe he also may have one eye very slightly higher in the other, which looks especially apparent in his age progression. The difference in the eyes may just be my perception though, which was another reason I wanted to hear what others thought.

I haven’t posted here before so if I need to provide anything additional like links to other websites or additional reconstructions let me know and I can add those here or in the comments. ",0,-

I ***highly*** recommend you do NOT watch the next-episode-preview at the end of episode 6 (i.e. tomorrow), as it will spoil something for episode 7. There's no post-credits scene after the ED, so you can simply turn the episode off during the ED to avoid the next-episode-preview.

Also don't look at the episode 7 title before starting the episode, if you can avoid it.

*Technically* Rararain and Sumomone both play guitar while Uiui plays (lefty) bass, but this is largely just because in the mobile game each character has to have *some* instrument. In practice, their music is all synths and software-generated instrumentation.

Deciding between a Sovol SV06 ACE or a Bambu A1 mini (I think...),"Hi everyone, I'm hoping to be a new 3D print user. I'm 100% in to functional prints for DIY. Realistically, I'll probably do less than a handful of prints a week, and maybe small batches of freecad designs once a month

  
I was initially looking at the Upgraded Tina2 3D Printer @ £151 (https://www.amazon.co.uk/WEEFUN-Upgraded-Leveling-Beginners-Removable-Tina2/dp/B09W9B959B)

And then the Bambu A1 mini (and ams lite(?) @ £169 (https://uk.store.bambulab.com/products/a1-mini) which seems to offer superb value for money, but I don't fully understand the implications of the Bambu updates, and whether it would affect me (I'd want to use the printer offline local network only)

But, going through the wiki, I'm becoming attracted to the SV06 ACE @ £239 (https://www.amazon.co.uk/Sovol-SV06-ACE-Structure-8-66x8-66x9-84/dp/B0DFYK5Q3L)

I can see the A1 has a bed of 180x180x180mm, and the SV06 is 220×220×250mm, which is obviously much larger, and with a higher price tag.

In terms of filament, it's something I need to understand, and can see the A1 supports PLA, PETG, TPU, PVA, and the SV06 a couple more (even though both nozzles are 300 degrees).

Looking at slicer software (I'm starting learning about with Orca Slicer), I can see Bambu has issues with Orca Slicer, whereas the SV06 doesn't.

Is the price difference between the two deserved? My budget is below/about £200, looking on amazon, I can see a few clones, and I'm slowly becoming confused, I don't think I know what features (or future features) I should be caring about? I'm not bothered about speed, but quality, and maybe being able to use different coloured/textured filaments would be good if that can be done with these?

Then, I see ANYCUBIC Kobra 3 @ £199 (https://www.amazon.co.uk/ANYCUBIC-Multicolor-Printing-Printers-Auto-Leveling/dp/B0D3QG5QC9) with a larger print bed of 250x250x260mm

Best website/app/tool for scheduling lessons?,"Hi all,  
As the school year is wrapping up next month, I'm looking ahead to the fall.

My students will be somewhat scattered to the wind over the summer, and I will also be taking some time off to travel.

In mid-August, I am planning to email all of my lesson families and poll them for their availability so I can create my regular teaching schedule starting in September.  I've had some students drop piano lessons, and I've taken on other new students who I've had to fit in to whatever spots were available.  I also have a few students on my waiting list who couldn't make it into my current openings, so I hope this will provide an opportunity to fit everyone in as we start a new school year.

My teaching hours are Mondays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays 3:00pm to 6:30pm and Wednesdays 1:30pm to 5:30pm.

I'm trying to think of the best way to get families' availabilities.  I want to know ALL the times they are available within my teaching hours, so then I can maximize my schedule with minimal gaps - I'm a traveling teacher.

What website, app, or other tool have you found works best for this?  I tried Google Forms, but that doesn't seem to differentiate each individual's response.  Sign Up Genius might work, but that makes you select a number of spots that are ""available.""  Doodle Polls have worked well for me in the past, but they only offer a limited number of slots.

It looks like my current best option is When2Meet, even though its purpose, like Sign Up Genius, is to find a common time that everyone can make (the opposite of what I want, which is everyone in their own separate time slot).

Thoughts?  I suppose I could just make a Google Doc with a bunch of check boxes for time slots and just have parents send it back to me with the boxes checked off, but maybe there's something I haven't yet tried

Edit: I would prefer a free resource at this point.  I may decide to invest into software like MyMusicStaff at a later time.",1,software
Dashcam alternative to Gear Guard,"So far we are really enjoying the two Rivian’s we’re using, but we have been seeing some small foibles pop-up. That happens, no dealbreakers, but one thing that is really disappointing (and coming from Tesla) is how Gear Guard just doesn’t work.

Consistently, and between both the R1T and R1S, we are met with storage device issues with brand new Samsung T1 drives connected to the USB-C. Moreover, times when it could have used it (like an impact from a bird on the windshield last week or some close calls) result in nothing being captured.

Really though, the bug with the storage device making Gear Guard useless makes the car as vulnerable as if we didn’t have anything. And it looks like we’re not alone.

So…I’m looking for dashcam alternatives that people are happy to use. I hate the fact that I have to buy and install more wired crap on the car given these vehicles have a dozen cams, and will wait for the inevitable software update (Tesla’s system was bad until it was suddenly very good, but that was around 2019-2020), but in the meantime does anyone have any good suggestions for a dashcam?

My Top 3 Tools for Ditching 90% of My Typing (And Staying Sane),"Hey everyone,  
I’ve been grinding on my SaaS product for the last few months, and honestly, my wrists were starting to scream. I'm a fast typer, but coding, writing documentation, responding to emails, it adds up. I was looking for a way to reduce the amount of typing I do on a daily basis.

I started experimenting with different ways to get words on the screen faster. After a lot of trial and error, I’ve settled on a setup that lets me speak what I want, and it does all the typing for me. I thought some of you fellow indie hackers might find it useful. Here’s what’s working for me:

1. Macros in VS Code (for code snippets): Seriously, if you're not using macros, you're missing out. I have common code blocks (like function headers, standard logging statements, etc.) mapped to short phrases. I just say the phrase, and boom—the whole block of code appears. This has sped up my coding significantly.
2. Custom ChatGPT Prompts (for content creation and writing): I’ve been crafting highly specific prompts that I can trigger with simple voice commands. For example, I say, “ChatGPT, summary of this documentation,” and it summarizes it. This works well. I still spend most of my time editing, but it gets my document about 80% of the way there.
3. Dictation Software with Filler Word Removal (for everything else): This is probably the biggest time-saver. I used to rely on the built-in dictation on Mac, but found the result was literally just me talking—complete with “um”s and “uh”s and a lot of repetition.

I tried a couple of different options. I think Google has one. I even heard about something called Otter that's supposed to clean up your speech in real time, but I haven’t tried that yet. I'm currently using WillowVoice, and I'm happy with the amount of time it saves me writing emails, taking notes, and just generally using my computer.

"Ajazz AK992 (no leds v.) works via bluetooth, wired but not via 2.4ghz","I have a Ajazz AK992 no lights version and it' currently working via bluetooth and wired, but not via dongle.  
Some time ago I was using my keyboard via 2.4 ghz and all of a sudden the 2.4ghz mode light started blinking and even if I resetted the keyboard on factory default (fn+spacebar for 3 secs) or resetted the 2.4ghz connection (fn+r for 5 seconds to make it blink faster and enter on pairing mode) the keyboard doesn't connect on the dongle 2.4.  
  
Other thing that looks strange is that it repairs well on another notebook I have when I do fn + R, and after I repair it with the dongle on the notebook and move the dongle to my pc, it works for like 5 minutes and then it starts to blink again as if lost the connection.   
  
I don't know how to fix the issue since the software for this specific version of ajazz's keyboard is sh\*\*, the manuals on the internet covers so little for the version with no lights or it brings wrong infos.  

Just for a reminder, on my pc I have a wireless mouse, wireless headset, and wireless controller (it's turned off), and I use wi-fi as internet source. Maybe interference? Idk...",1,software_external

FLAIR: Was This Air Force 747 Frozen in Time by UAP Tech? TicTac UFOs to the Rescue!  
  
In this mind-bending encounter, a fast-moving TicTac craft appears to intervene as an Air Force 747—retrofitted with UAP technology—malfunctions mid-flight. My original theory was that a disguised UAP (possibly shaped like a downsized airliner) was being rescued. But after further analysis, I believe this aircraft was headed for Davis-Monthan AFB when it glitched while flying near the massive satellite dishes at the AT&T Broadcast Center (SWUF), visible on Google Maps.  
  
The frozen, time-locked appearance of the aircraft—and its oddly tiny scale—may be explained by space-time distortion or Fresnel lensing effects, as suggested by ChatGPT. Could we be witnessing the limits of experimental military tech... or something even more advanced?

Question about png export (graininess),"Hello everyone! 

Months ago I had the chance to try the Atelier app on the Nomad. I loved how the drawing looked on the device (especially the pencil), but when I tried exporting the png it was very grainy, and made of black-and-white dots rather than grayscale.

Is this a limitation of e-ink technology in general, or is it something that can be fixed with software in a future update? (Or has it already been fixed in the months since I tried it?)

I really enjoyed the drawing feel of the Supernote compared to an iPad, and I’m thinking that even if the dithering is unavoidable on e-ink I might still get one just for the joy of sketching.

Nothing phone 3a vs OnePlus 13R which phone should I go with?,"Hi I am planning to buy a new phone as my current phone is on the verge of giving out. My phone usage is moderate-heavy. I want to preferably be able to use this phone for next 3-4 years. Basically the things that I am looking for in a phone include:
- great screen cause I am a bit picky when it comes to screen colours and accuracy also it's sharpness.
- good cameras that can take decent photos as I like to travel.
- Great battery back up.
- decent speakers so that I don't have to always have to search for my headphones.
- prefer a good haptic motor feedback.
Also wanted to know what you all think about Oxygen os and Nothing os and what would you suggest would be better for a better overall software experience in daily use case scenarios.",0,-
"YSK: YSK: When you need to download software, go to the Wikipedia page for that software and click on the official website link to avoid fake websites and malicious apps.","Why YSK:

These links tend to be accurate, especially for popular or widely-used apps, because:

* Wikipedia has many active editors who correct false information quickly.
* Malicious edits are usually flagged and reverted fast, especially for high-traffic pages.
* Each link is ideally cited and reviewed by the community.

This is how I usually do it:

1. Search for the app on Wikipedia, especially if it's well-known (like VLC, Blender, KeePass, etc.).

2. Click the official website link, but double-check the URL. Is it a familiar domain? (e.g., blender.org, not blender-downloads.xyz). Does it match the expected name of the developer or project?

3. Optionally, cross-reference with other sources. Search Google or DuckDuckGo with ""official site"" \[software name\]. Check GitHub (if open-source). Look for verification from trusted tech blogs.

4. Trust, but verify. After downloading the software, upload it to a website that scans for malicious software and if it has no flags, you're good. If it has one or two, it's probably a false alarm.

Alternatively, you could just use the Microsoft Store (Windows), App Store (Mac), or your Linux package manager. But if you can't find the software through that method, or it's outdated, then I recommend my method for manually downloading software and keeping your machine safe.",0,-

GoXLR Mini starting to fail :(,"My GoXLRMini has started playing up for no reason, its been fine for years and now sometimes it will crash and i will loose control over my audio volume. I can still mute and use the bleep button, but i loose ALL volume control entireley. I know when its freaking out cos the lights on it start turning on and off alot, a simple unplug and replug the USB cable seems to fix it but its already getting annoying as frick., and happened during a twitch stream just last week. Nothing broke, i still had audio, but I had NO control over volume of anything.  

So, i guess im in the market for a new device! As i understand it the GoXLR team were fired again not long ago so now its unsupported?......So i think im done with the GoXLR for good now. Its going to die forever one day anyway if theres no dev team so whats the point, its already going wrong for me. 

I stream to Twitch and make YouTube videos, so need something that allows me phsyical audio control without needing to tough the software once its set up. And am currently stuck between the Wave XLR from Elgato, which seems VERY popular. But theres only one dial on it, and everything else is controlled through software which i dont like.

The StreamDeck+ with the XLR dock is great but also £300, thats way too much for me and I cannot justify that price. I do Twitch and YouTube as a hobby not a job, i dont make a dime out of it so dont have much budget . 

So my other choice that answers all the things I want from it, is the Hercules Stream 200 XLR. Control of up to 8 audios with physical dials to control them. Mic, chat, music, system, game whatever else I would need. Once set up correctly I wouldnt ever need to look at the software ever again. Which I really like. I want to be able to control all my audio on the fly like i do with my GoXLR Mini. Oh discord is too loud, fiddle with the dial, music is quiet, fiddle the dial etc etc. 

And being able to throw some real basic compression and limiter on the mic line so I dont clip when streaming is nice too, aswell as tweaking the EQ to make my voice sound all buttery smooth.

I might end up missing the bleep button on the GoXLR though :( 

Are there any other AFFORDABLE options out there that will answer what I want? I keep seeing mixed reviews of the Hercules Stream 200 XLR, some say its brilliant and others say its lacking and underpowered. 

I currently have an Audio-technica AT2020 XLR microphone, and dont have plans to upgrade that ever really. So long as it still works it will be my forever mic, i love it.

Midrange Controller comparison - reviewed on docked Steam Deck,"[The Lineup](https://preview.redd.it/hfwnseaxss0f1.jpg?width=1876&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=07b98f47146191af0b178cd0147f81c15976745f)

I guess this is half reviews, half controller collection. Mods, if I've got the flair wrong please advise. 

I’ve been on a controller buying kick lately, and ended up with a few (I purchased all of these, and received nothing for free or in exchange for opinions). I thought I’d give a TL:DR overview of each one, since they’re all similar and priced similarly to each other and very comparable (charging dock, TMR sticks, back paddles).  Of course, the TL:DR turned into a Long anyway.

Regarding software: I’m 100% Linux and use these with my Steam Deck, so they’re only getting used through SteamInput anyway. Some of these offer Android software for configuration though, which helps.

This is mostly a player overview, not an in-depth analysis of latency and stuff, there’s plenty of that sort of thing out there. I tend to play retro games, platformers, run-and-gun, twin stick shooters, and JRPGs.  Every once in a while I’ll do an FPS or an over-the-shoulder shooter but they’re not my biggest favorites. I’m testing over a dongle exclusively for the higher reporting rate and lower latency.

My personal D-Pad test is Asteroids Recharged. Accidental diagonals will end up thrusting me forward, so it’s pretty easy to tell. 

I was inspired to do this by LTT’s Hall Controller showdown thing…of which none of these were included. 

All opinions are my own, etc etc etc. And they are my opinions, but I hope the information here is valuable to others when trying to decide between one of these. 

Feel free to ask any questions about these controllers and i’ll try to get some game time in to answer them. 

# Gamesir Cyclone 2 - $56 on Amazon

The mechanical buttons feel great. The D-pad is a little interesting, because I have two of these, and one of them is extremely precise, but the other one hits diagonals very easily, so I’d rate them separately on my Asteroids Recharged test. I’ve heard stories of both, so their quality here may just be inconsistent.  The triggers are fantastic, and while the trigger stops are in an unusual location, they’re pretty much impossible to switch by accident, or by pulling on the trigger too hard, and switching them to hair trigger mode engages a mechanical switch.  Unfortunately, that also means you’re pausing the game to switch modes if you want to, or switching it before you start playing, and I’m finding that every once in a while I do want to switch them mid-game. The back paddles feel nice and are hard to hit by accident unless you have an iron grip, but there are only two of them. The sticks feel fantastic; they’re fairly tight, which I have a strong preference for, so if you prefer lighter stick tension, these might not be for you.

Ergonomically, it feels identical to an Xbox controller in the best possible way. There’s no rubber grip but the plastic texture is very grippy on its own and won’t degrade the same as a rubber coating would. The frosted and smoked plastic allows the RGB lighting to diffuse in a way that’s visually interesting and different from the typical light bars and rings. The dock is not the best for securing the device (it really sort of sits rather than locking in place), but having the dongle facing forward and unblocked is always a nice thing for a clean wireless signal. Switching modes means holding the home button and using ABXY, plus using Start+Select when using the dongle or a cable, which can be a little much to remember at times, though it offers flexibility (side note: D-Input makes the controller appear as a Dual Shock 4 in SteamOS, and the rear paddles default to point-touches on the touchpad, while the Share button is a full pad push).

This controller is one of my favorites, though I prefer the smoke over the frost: I prefer more subtle RGB. It’s not the most feature rich controller out there but it definitely creates a great price/performance balance in an attractive and ergonomic package, and should be on the consideration list. 

# EasySMX D10 - $55 on [EasySMX.com](http://EasySMX.com)

After the smash hit of the X20, this has big shoes to fill, and it comes close but doesn’t quite make it. There’s only two rear paddles, down from four. Also, the D-pad switched to a shield/disc style. It’s all mechanical, so the feedback is there, but in another step down from the X20 the diagonals are too easy to hit for me: I ended up doing a lot of unintended thrusting in Asteroids Recharged. The buttons feel great and are very responsive, but the sticks are a little too easy to move for my taste, and while the triggers feel fine the travel on them is a bit short. The trigger stop switches are standard, and very easy to use quickly as you game (so be careful if you don’t want to). The stops use a mechanical switch instead of a plastic stop, so they feel great.  Also it uses a physical switch to switch between dongle/switch/BT modes, which is always easier to remember than button combinations.  While in dongle mode on SteamOS, X-Input shows as a generic X-Box controller, but D-Input actually shows as an EasySMX D10, and the rear buttons repeat L3 and R3 by default. There’s also no Android app for these, but there’s no Windows app either, so study the manual to learn how to configure it.

The grips use a stippling pattern for grip, but it’s a bit smoother than the Gamesir: not slippery, but a little less grippy. It’s also translucent plastic but the RGB strips pretty much shine through intact without taking advantage of the colored plastic to add diffusion or effects. Also, I’m not sure I’m a fan of the color schemes (white front, grey back, and green or purple grips and buttons). The home button is sandwiched in between Start and Select (or whatever you want to call them), and there’s no Share button, so it’s a little easy to hit the wrong button.  Overall, this controller is very usable but not my favorite: for me, this is going to be a guest controller, but I wouldn’t mind using it occasionally. This is really a personal preference controller: if you’re looking for easy diagonals on the D-pad (for fighting games maybe) and light-effort sticks, this may end up working very well for you. 

# 8BitDo Ultimate 2C - $60 on Amazon with dock

I’ve been using these guys since they were a clone SNES controller maker. And you can still see that DNA in this device (particularly in their D-Pads, though they have gotten a touch looser lately), though I can understand them wanting to get away from that: they are absolutely a serious third party controller maker, and have put the work in to get there. The buttons here are membrane and the D-pad is dome, which is great for people who don’t like the mechanical switch trend. In fact it feels like the trigger stops move in a dome switch rather than a mechanical one, and it feels solid with good tactile feedback (the stop switches move horizontally so they’re easy to reach and switch but hard to pull on by accident). This is a MUCH quieter controller than the general run of mechanically-switched ones that have been trending lately. The anti-friction rings are also the RGB, and they have some interesting effects when buttons are pressed. The sticks feel almost as good as the Gamesir ones as far as being tight and easy to use. The button positions are fantastic, and while there’s only two back paddles, there’s two extra shoulder buttons (“claw” buttons) which I think I prefer over four back paddles, and they’re very easy to access comfortably…in fact they’re probably easier for me to use than the actual shoulders, since my fingers resting on the triggers puts my fingertips on the additional claw buttons, so they’re positioned quite well.

Unfortunately, the gyro on this is disabled, and there’s no DualShock mode…also, I don’t get why they included plus and minus (Switch) buttons for Start and Select but used an X-box button layout, doesn’t make a lot of sense, especially at a price point where others include D-input and gyro.  Also, the grips are only grippy on the bottom, not the top, and as per usual for 8BitDo, they’re angled a lot further inward than most other asymmetrical controllers. Still, if you don’t mind tucking your elbows in tight and don’t need gyro it’s a great controller, especially with the claw buttons. Supposedly a firmware is coming to allow this to work better with the SteamDeck, but for right now it’s Xinput only over the dongle, and appears as a generic X-box pad, and the claw and back buttons don’t appear and are unmapped by default.

# Beitong Kunpeng 40 (KP40) - $70 for controller, $12 for dock on Amazon

I was excited about this one because it’s the only TMR setup I know of that has adjustable tension. It also uses TMR triggers, but the trigger locks are only stops, not microswitches. They still work fine, and make the triggers a lot faster, but it’s not quite the same as an immediate mechanical switch. Unfortunately every time I hit the left bumper when connected to my Deck over dongle, it’d kick off a 5 minute rumble. And that’s not the biggest problem with the device, which is scary given the pricing. 

Hopefully you like white, because that’s the only color available, though it’s a nice minimalist design. So minimalist that the logo is the only visible RGB: the light strips tend to be covered by your hands. Also, they use some unusual button combinations for things like mode switching and even turning off the controller, which doesn’t auto-connect when removed from the dock,and also doesn’t auto-off when placed in the dock. More bad: the dongle only seems to work in Switch mode on the Steam Deck, which is really bugging me, because for a dished D-pad it did really well on my Asteroids Recharged test.  In fact, it did well, period, dished D-Pad or no. I tried to use Bluetooth, and it would crash my Deck while attempting to connect (and only supports X-Input mode anyway). Finally, while you have adjustable stick tension rings, they are NOT anti-friction, so they don’t feel wonderful out at the end of the stick travel, though they’re no worse than a standard X-Box controller.

I really wanted to like this controller. And I did like many aspects of it. But there’s too many issues with it, and it doesn’t help that their software for managing the controller seems to be unavailable (the website exists, the links exist, but they’re dead). Between that and the high price…if you’re a Switch or Windows user you can probably get a lot more out of this than I did. I don’t use either of those platforms though. And apparently the Steam Deck issues are well known, so maybe I should have done some more research on this one before purchasing.  If anyone still cares after reading, the grips are smooth top and bottom too. They’re not “shiny” smooth but they’re definitely slippery. Given the price tag, even for Switch and Windows users I’d say this is a hard pass. 

# ThundeRobot G80 - $57 on Amazon for upgraded model, plus $8-12 for TMR sticks on AliExpress

This is another interesting one, because it was never actually released in the US officially, but is widely available (anything on Amazon counts as “widely” available). This has swappable stick modules to vary tension, plus claw buttons, optical face buttons, and rumble/feedback in the triggers. It’s also got swappable faceplates, and the color scheme is interesting: black and SNES-style purples for highlights somehow just works (there’s also a white/beige that looks pretty good). Also, this is the only gamepad that didn’t start off as a TMR, but as a high resolution hall setup. 

It should be made clear that there are two editions of this controller: The base model includes the dock and replacement white sticks (the preinstalled ones are the orange). The upgraded model adds a black stick, a blue stick, taller sticks, and a replacement faceplate with a more intricate design. The sticks go like this from lightest to heaviest:

* White (320 gf)
* Blue (540 gf)
* Orange (700 gf)

These are K-Silver JH20 swappable stick modules, and are available in both hall (JH20) and TMR (JS20) variants. So if you want a second blue or black, or want to go TMR, may as well go for it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            

I wish ThundeRobot had given us a cross-style d-pad here (It’s actually Machenike but ThundeRobot is a better name anyway). I also kind of dislike the status indicator location in the middle of the button diamond. It’s the only real RGB on the controller, too, but it’s not the end of the world to live without it, though you miss out on a few indications such as low battery warning, and a macro recording indicator. Also, this device does NOT have many reviews out there, though I know u/OldManRob13 did one, and I found it very informative. In reality, this is a variant of the Machenike G5 Pro V2 (even uses the same stick modules, though this actually comes with extras, while the G5 Pro V2 doesn’t). This can be had for significantly less, so unless you like RGB this one seems like the no-brainer choice, and I’m surprised so few people have reviewed this one. 

The D-pad was right up there with the Beitong as far as precision goes, even though I don’t find it as pleasing to my thumb as a cross, and the controller feels just as good in the hands as the Gamesir. The triggers feel great, but I ended up leaving the trigger rumble off. 

D-Input mode actually shows up as a Gamesir T4 Mini, while X-Input mode appears as a “Neo 2021.” For both of these modes, the back paddles mirror L3/R3 and the left claw mirrors the X button, while the right claw appears to be unmapped. The claw button positioning is just as perfect as the 8BitDo, but the trigger rumble is a little hit-or-miss. At this price point, even if they don’t work and I have to turn them off I’m not disappointed. 

I went on for quite a bit on this controller, so you can tell I’m quite taken with it. But it’s not perfect. The swappable faceplates are pretty smooth, though the bottom of the grips are OK (the Gamesir is the cream of the crop here). The tops are actually not slippery…but there also isn’t any detectable stippling, so I don’t know if it’ll hold up or wear down over time. At least there’s a replacement faceplate. As mentioned, the “status RGB” seems like an afterthought, and kind of a dumb one. The dock is super light, but the device sits on there securely after being placed.

I have trouble not justifying this controller. You have fairly heavy sticks if you like that, you have light effort sticks if you like that, you have four function buttons, turbo…I suppose if RGB is a requirement this won’t fit the bill, that’s about it. But otherwise it should be on the consideration list. 

# What I’m using…

I kind of avoid using the 8BitDo: as much as I like the feel of the claw buttons, I don’t like scrunching my elbows in. The Beitong…yeah, I should have done a little more research. It’s going in a drawer somewhere: I wish I could use it but I can’t even upgrade the firmware if they fix it. The EasySMX D10…it’s a good controller but doesn’t fit my needs or preferences. It’ll be good to keep around for guest players, like the 8BitDo. That leaves the Gamesir Cyclone 2 and the ThundeRobot G80. I like them both but in different ways. 

I like the stick caps on the Cyclone 2 better, and the cross D-pad feels a little better under my thumb, but I love the claw buttons on the G80 and it’s disc-shaped D-pads are just as accurate. The G80 also has a separate button mostly for programming turbo, which helps quite a bit. The triggers have a little more travel on the Cyclone 2, but have the rumble option in the G80 and are easier to switch to hair trigger mode. The face buttons on the G80 are a little quieter also (plus), and have a bit less travel (sometimes a minus?). Both devices feel equally smooth in gameplay There’s so many things that are similar or the same on both, though the G80 lets you put in lighter effort sticks while with the Cyclone 2 you’re stuck with their high tension ones. But since I like high tension sticks, that’s a tie for me. I’m always switching from one to the other and I’m glad I have both. For all I know, it could be down to the convex stick caps on the Cyclone 2 versus the concave ones on the G80. Oh, the sticks are swappable on the G80 also, though I haven’t found a place to get replacements. ",0,-

2025 Short CS Admissions Profile for Class of 2026,"While applying this year, one of the most helpful resources I found on this subreddit was the 2023 Ultimate CS Guide by ScrubbyArtist and the 2024 CS Guide by WinterJacob. So, I thought it would be appropriate for me to try and provide the same kind of help for next year's applicants. 

This guide will be CS-focused.

I’ll be honest: this guide won’t be very helpful if you’re not aiming for Waterloo or UofT, mostly because those were the schools I focused on and tailored my grades and extracurriculars (ECs) around.

Quick Background:
 Ontario student with a 98–99% average, lots of STEM-related ECs and executive positions, a standout summer program, and volunteering experience

Unlike other guides, I’ll just be talking about the “Big 4” I applied to: UofT, Waterloo, McMaster, and McGill. Realistically, if you have a 94–96% average, you should be competitive for the other schools I applied to.

 Quick notes: I’m not including anything about the Laurier side of UW CS + BBA because I didn’t even fill out the supplemental application and still got in. Honestly, I don’t even know anyone else who applied there, so I left it out. Also, I didn’t get into Dev Degree only Carleton CS because I forgot to submit my supplemental application in time. But if you’re applying to CS in 2026, definitely look into the program. It’s super cool, and I would have taken it over Mac, McGill, or even UTSC maybe even UTSG.

P.S. I don’t think any of these schools care about OUAC ranking for CS except UOttawa (they do, for some reason).

McMaster Computer Science (1)

Estimated Admission Average: 96–97%+ to be safe, but lower averages have gotten in due to the supplemental component. Mac’s admission decisions this year seemed a bit random, especially outside of CS.

- Likely grade-based admissions over the supplemental.

- I half-assed the supplement, to be honest. I had already gotten my Scarborough offer (which I prioritized over Mac), so I did it with no prep but still got in, likely due to my grades. If your average isn’t in the high 90s, I recommend spending at least 30 minutes on it.

- Still a solid program with everything you need for a good CS career: co-op, decent research, and a good community.



McGill – Bachelor of Arts (CS)

McGill posts admissions averages on their website. I applied to the BA (because I didn’t take chemistry), and I think the minimum average was around 92%. I don’t know many others who applied.

- Purely grades-based admissions no supplemental required.

- From what I’ve heard, it’s a well-rounded program with strong rankings, good research opportunities, and a vibrant community/student life.

- BA CS vs. BSc CS doesn't make a real difference unless you're thinking about grad school.

- Arts degree requirements at McGill are a bit odd, and there’s a French requirement, so be aware.

- You declare your CS major in second year Guaranteed unlike UBC, which is why I didn’t apply there.

- French Canadians. (Jk)


UofT Scarborough – CS Co-op

Likely Admission Average: 96–97%+, with an emphasis on Math and English grades. I didn’t know many people who applied to CS at UTSC, but those I did know mostly got in. (Weirdly, someone I know with a 99% got into UTSG in February but still hadn’t heard back from UTSC as of March.)
Carries the UofT name (cool, but not super important).


- Traditional co-op format (3 terms vs. UW’s 6), but you graduate in 4 years.

- No exclusive recruiting differences between UTSC and UTSG according to profs; UTSG just gets more events.

- You can take classes at UTSG. ( You have less priority if the classes are filling up )

- Underrated program: great profs, interesting CS streams, solid research.

- Downsides: the campus is isolated, it's a commuter school with a limited student life. Scarborough is… mid, to be honest. Still, solid academically.


UofT St. George – CS

Likely Admission Average: 97–98%. At my school, those who got in had 98%+ averages and excellent ECs. Definitely hardest school to get into grades wise for CS.

- The supplemental app was a bit odd. I only mentioned Robotics and my software dev co-op, even though I had more ECs. I rushed it the night before the deadline and used AI to fix grammar/intonation but still got in during the March round. This tells me UofT might not care too much about content in the sup app, as long as you seem like a decent human with genuine passion.

- If your average is below 96–97%, I’m not sure how much the supplemental app will help.

- Has the Arts & Science Internship Program (ASIP), like co-op but optional. Some students skip it to graduate earlier or pursue summer internships. One student I know landed a Microsoft Azure ML co-op in first year through research.

- One of the best campuses in Ontario, in a vibrant city.

- Incredible profs including Nobel Prize winner in ML but you won’t see them until 3rd or 4th year of CS

- Best CS program in Canada if you love math-heavy CS or research or want a more traditional school schedule. 


Waterloo CS / CS-BBA / CFM

Admission Range: You’re in the running with a 95%+. I've seen lower averages get in. The AIF is very important, more so than many assume. A strong AIF + 95–97% beats a mid/weak AIF + 99%.
They prioritize math grades, but not as obsessively as people think.

- Overall, this is the best CS program in Canada when considering outcomes, prestige, research, and co-op if you disregard student life.

- Contest scores don’t really matter, just do them. Failing them isn’t a big deal if you have solid grades and AIF. Everyone who I know got in had average to below average contest scores

- UW CS isn’t a ticket to a free job. The job margins for grads at FAANG+ aren’t drastically different from other top schools like UofT, Mac, or UBC. As long as you work hard you can make it work anywhere

- Great opportunities like Velocity (startups) and IQC (quantum research)

- I didn’t get in despite having strong grades and math marks so probably my AIF wasn’t top-tier.

- Don’t exaggerate your EC hours or list 15 random ones. Be honest, show your passion, and how your interests align with UW CS. Do not use AI to fluff your writing (like I did)

- The campus gets hate, but it’s not that bad. Two of my friends who graduated from UW said it felt homey after a year

- If you don’t get CS, you may fall into: Math Co-op → Geomatics → Rejection. One person I know had a 99% average and ended up in Geomatics, while others with 95–96% got CS and even top engineering programs.

- TL;DR: No one knows the real formula for getting into UW CS. Don’t pin all your hopes on it. Just work hard and stay passionate, maybe UW will happen along the way.


Closing Thoughts

- Am I mad about how admissions turned out? Honestly, no. I knew from the beginning that getting into UofT or UW was a gamble. Getting into UTSG was enough to make me happy.
- As for grade inflation, it’s hard to say. My school is full of high-achievers, and we applied to attend it for that reason. I’ve noticed some of our courses were easier than those in top Oakville schools. Our class medians were usually in the high 80s or low 90s (some “bird” courses like Music and CS were even mid-90s).
- I did apply to American schools but let’s just say that did not go well but I did not put as much effort as I did into my Canadian school applications. I know one person who is going to Princeton for ENG from our school so it def is possible but it is a diff beast compared to anything in Canada.  


Good Luck Class of 2026 hope yall CS admission goes well.

Software for umbrella group of companies,"Hi all, looking for software to help me streamline 4 companies (currently, could grow) 1 company, multiple DBAs.

1 is pest control, so tracking materials purchased and used. So I could  comply with government regulations. Others are power washing, things like that.

Wants or add-ons as needed if the company grows:

Route optimizing, optimizing scheduling, customer portal to view/pay invoices, secure storage of credit card info for payments, ability to send quotes electronically that have and ""accept quote"" in the quote (maybe customer scheduling at some point), accept payments in person on a phone preferred (machine if necessary), 

I'm sure there's much more - but that's not of the to of my head.

GirillaDesk is what I'm leaning towards if familiar with that. But that's designed with pest control  in mind first and foremost. I do other things - so I thought I would reach out here for an all-in-one solution before I jump into GorillaDesk, only to realize I need something more all encompassing

Laptop recommendations!,"Hey everyone,

I’m looking to buy a laptop that can comfortably run design software like Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, Rhino, Revit, and some rendering tools (like V-Ray or Enscape). I’m not gaming (I have a ps5 already) this is mainly for architecture and creative work.

My budget is around $1,500–$2,000. I’d love something that’s powerful but also portable enough to work from anywhere (coffee shops, travel, etc.).

Would appreciate any recs on specific models or specs I should be aiming for!

Thanks!",0,-

"Like it or not, you have to respect ID Software for trying to do something different with the DOOM games instead of sticking with the same fomat.","So as you may have known, **DOOM: The Dark Ages** recently hit the stores, and opinions are flying all over the place. Some like it, some don’t, but in the end it’s a very good and fun game (according to the reviews I’ve read).

That being said, one sentiment I noticed while browsing through subreddits, reviews, forums, etc., is the opinion on how ""different"" TDA is compared to Eternal — at least from a gameplay standpoint.

Now before I go over what I’m about to say, just keep in mind this is purely personal opinion. You can like and dislike any DOOM game, that’s okay. I like DOOM 2016 more than Eternal. Eternal is a good game, don’t get me wrong, but I like 2016 more. And I’m looking forward to playing The Dark Ages.

Now let’s talk about the “issue” here. As you know, TDA’s gameplay has a very different focus compared to DOOM 2016 and Eternal, with a style built more around — as the devs said — “stand and fight,” instead of 2016’s “run and gun” and Eternal’s “jump and shoot.” In my personal opinion, I really liked this new style of gameplay.

And that’s the point I’m trying to make here. As you know, one common sentiment around the AAA gaming industry is how it’s become “stale,” “uninspiring,” or “formulaic.” And this has been growing more and more with recent titles — at least AAA ones. I bet if you spend enough time on YouTube, Reddit, or forums, you’ve seen someone say something like, “\[Insert AAA game franchise\] is the same game every time.” Not exactly in those words, but you get the idea.

But what am I trying to get at?

One opinion I’ve seen pop up a lot in videos, subreddits, even Twitter, is that DOOM: The Dark Ages is a bad game because it’s different from DOOM Eternal.

And that kinda weirds me out. Because a lot of the people saying that are probably the same ones who complain all the time about how stale the recent Call of Duty games have become.

I can understand the sentiment behind it, in a way — because the same thing happened with DOOM Eternal and DOOM 2016. Heck, I had the same opinion at one point. I didn’t like Eternal at first because, for me, it felt “too technical.” My views have changed since then, but you get my point.

Some people didn’t like how Eternal played compared to 2016, and that’s OKAY! Not every game has to be for everyone.

And that’s why I’m making this post. Whether you like the game or not, all I ask is for you to at least respect ID Software for doing something new. In an industry so fed up with boring and uninspired titles, something new is always welcome - even if it doesn’t turn out well in the end. Don’t bash the game just because it’s different from what you’re used to. For all it’s worth, ID deserves at least some respect for sticking to their principles don't you think?. In all honestly, we should be happy that ID has brought us 3 distinct modern Doom games. All equally replayable and none of them obsolesces the others.

Once again: I’m not saying you’re obliged to love DOOM TDA. I just want people do understand and respect ID Software for trying something new instead of going down the same safe route so many other studios take.

Of course i may be right or wrong. Feel free to correct me if I got something wrong. And yes, I know I may be “exaggerating” a bit about it, but I still think this post is worth making.

I love the DOOM games, and I’m excited to buy and play The Dark Ages.

TL;DR: Respect the devs for trying something new even if you don’t like it.",0,-
Which job should I pursue?,"Currently working as a Software Development Engineer in Test or QA for 3 years in Indonesia since I(M25) finished my bachelor degree in computer science. Right now I'm contemplating which options should I go for:

1. Continue my career as an SDET and improve my skills by getting a certification like ISTQB, maybe I could land a remote job with better salary
2. Try to pursue a new career path with better pay ceiling

For option 2, I've been thinking about getting a master degree in either Europe/Australia in hope that I can move to live/work in a better country. But the problem is I don't know what degree/job that I want to get yet. I'm looking for high paying jobs, high demand, and not easily replaced by AI. Some people recommended me cyber security, devops engineer, and cloud engineer. Would also love to hear your suggestion on this. I don't mind learning something new, and I'm confident that I can learn it no matter how hard it is.

Is there a way to roll the latest software update back?,"Hi. I'm trying to help out an elderly relative here. They have a Samsung galaxy, one of the older models from a few years ago, and as expected it's difficult as is for them to figure it out. I guess there was a software update several days ago and it's been a total nightmare for them navigating it. Seems like it changed the overall look and feel of the phone and now my relative is perpetually frustrated since they were finally getting used to a smartphone. The most difficult change for them is the fact that you have to scroll down on either the top left or right part of the screen in order to see your notifications. It's made it more challenging for them just to use the phone since they have bad eyesight + arthritis in their hands. 


Is there any way to roll it back to the previous update? It would really help my relative be able to still use their phone. Thanks.",1,software_external
Pi/Python programmer needed,"I need a python programmer to assist me with a simple open source project.  I'm trying to learn Pis and Python and can't find any community college classes locally, or anything decent online at reasonable cost.

I’m a hardware/systems guy.  I can spec software functionality, flowchart it, etc, but I’m simply no good at writing it.  Heck, one of my programmer friends used Chat GTP to write this code and I still can’t get it to work as I have no experience with the practicalities of getting it loaded, debugged, and running.  Having to learn FORTRAN on punch cards and Basic on an emulator running time-share on a PDP-11/70 just sucked what little fun there might have been in it back when I had to learn programming.

The project: 

I’m a member of a racing community where we need to scale the cars.  The scales are just aluminum pads with a 4-wire load cell inside.  Most of these systems are at least a decade old if not two or more, and  wired to a display unit based on analog technology.  They cost a couple thousand bucks in today’s money.

If the head unit dies, you’re screwed.  There are only a couple of companies that make these things, and they are unlikely to attempt a fix (even if parts are available), preferring to sell you another multi-thousand dollar system.  The new ones are mostly wireless.

So my project is to create a wireless 4-scale system based on Raspberry Pis and HX-711 load cell interfaces.  My hardware concept is 4 battery powered devices, one for each scale, perhaps with individual displays.  Next level is to make those 4 devices connect to a central Pi with its own display.  Next level would be a phone interface, although that seems to bring app store grief.

I’ll provide the Pis and scales, guidance, testing, breadboards, and whatever else you might need.  I’m in Tehachapi and I also have power supplies, breadboards, a bunch of meters, etc.  I can drag all of that to your location.  I’ll 3d print housings for the parts.  If you would prefer Arduino, we can talk about that - looking for whatever makes sense.

I look at this as giving back to the community I love. I’ll post the prints to Thingiverse,  Code would be posted to a site under a similar common-use license to the one Thingiverse uses.  I’ll have to do some research on that.  ",1,software_hardware
I tested Lottery Defeater Software for a month and here’s what actually happened,"I’ve always been curious about the lottery. Not because I think I’ll win millions, but because I like the *what if*. That little moment of possibility when you’re holding your ticket before the numbers drop. Still, I knew deep down that playing randomly or picking birthdays wasn’t doing me any favors.

That’s why I started looking into different tools and strategies. Somewhere in that search, I came across something called **Lottery Defeater Software**. The name sounded a little bold, but the concept wasn’t about “beating the system” it was more about making smarter picks.

I figured if I was already playing, I might as well try doing it a little more thoughtfully. So I gave it a month. Here’s everything I learned.

**What is Lottery Defeater Software, really?**

If you’ve never heard of it, **Lottery Defeater Software** is a tool that uses data from past draws to help you choose numbers that are less likely to be picked by others. It’s not trying to predict what numbers *will* win. That’s impossible.

Instead, the idea behind this **lottery software** is that if you *do* win, you’re less likely to split the jackpot. It also helps avoid the most common mistakes lottery players make like always picking numbers between 1 and 31 (because of birthdays) or repeating patterns like 1-2-3-4-5-6.

I signed up using this link: [**Lottery Defeater Software**](https://www.fasttrack01.com/MM8QQX91/2DH289SW/?source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/LotteryStrategy) and dove in.

**What it's like using the lottery defeater system**

Getting started was simple. You log in, pick the lottery game you’re playing - Powerball, Mega Millions, or a local one - and the software generates a set of numbers based on its analysis.

What I liked right away is that the number combinations looked… balanced. Not like anything I would have chosen on my own. Some higher numbers, some lower ones, nothing too neat or predictable.

For a few weeks, I played using only the number sets from the **lottery defeater system**. No lucky numbers, no birthdays, no random quick picks. Just what the software gave me.

**Did it help me win?**

I didn’t hit a jackpot. But I did win small prizes twice during the month, which, to be fair, is already better than usual for me. More than that, I just felt more in control of the process.

There’s something reassuring about knowing your picks are based on patterns and probability rather than gut feelings or randomness. I still knew my odds were slim, but I also knew I wasn’t making the same obvious choices as everyone else.

If you’re curious, here’s the other link I used to check out the system:  
[**Lottery Defeater System**](https://www.fasttrack01.com/MM8QQX91/2DH289SW/?uid=28107&source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/LotteryStrategy)

**What I liked most**

* **Easy to use** – No tech skills needed. Everything was clear and simple.
* **Better number variety** – Helped me break out of my usual patterns.
* **Less overlap with other players** – That’s probably the biggest benefit. If you win, you want the whole prize, not a slice of it.

**What to keep in mind**

This software isn’t going to magically change the odds of the lottery. The game is still based on chance. What it *does* do is help you avoid common pitfalls and give you number combinations that are more balanced and unique.

It’s also not free. So if you’re someone who buys one ticket every six months, it might not be worth the investment. But if you play often, even casually, it could make the experience more strategic.

**Final thoughts on lottery defeated software**

What I liked most about **Lottery Defeater Software** is that it took some of the randomness out of the equation. I still knew it was a long shot, but at least I was putting more thought into it. It felt smarter, and oddly enough, more fun.

It doesn’t promise to win the lottery for you. But it does promise to help you play in a way that makes a little more sense.

So if you’re the kind of person who plays regularly and likes the idea of having a strategy, this might be something worth trying. It added structure to a game that’s usually all luck, and for me, that made it more interesting.

Has anyone else tried using tools like this? Would be great to hear different experiences.",0,-

Looking to learn  Logic Pro,"I know that using LP helps me learn it, but I feel I’m really inefficient, I am looking to find a course and/or tutor that could help me be more systematic about it.

I write mostly “Western classical” music.  I use notation software for the most part but have been playing around in LP as well.  And though this is just for hobby purposes, I want to do more than just “play around” with it. 

Has anyone had much success with a course and/or a tutor?  This is outside of my professional area, so I don’t even know what is available for this kind of learning.  ",1,not_applicable
"As expected, some fans are canceling their preorders for Doom the Dark Ages.","As expected, some fans are canceling their preorders for Doom the Dark Ages, which shouldn't be a big shock, at this point. I feel bad for id Software because they obviously put a lot of hard work and effort into the game. Honestly, it looks like it's a lot of fun. However, sales numbers are probably going to take a bit of a substantial dip, but it's Microsoft's fault when it's all said and done. It's been a constant uphill battle for consumers when it comes to physical media, especially as of late. It keeps getting worse with every passing day. Nintendo has been the biggest culprit, as well as the least consumer-friendly company that's out there. 

That's not to say that Microsoft is any better. If anything, they're just as bad, if not worse than Nintendo. Phil Spencer could care less about preserving physical media. As far as Microsoft is concerned, this has been an issue ever since Halo Infinite came out back in 2021. The entire game had to be downloaded from the Internet. The same goes for Starfield and a bunch of other Xbox titles as well. Obsidian Entertainment is owned by Xbox, which means that The Outer Worlds 2 will also require an Internet connection. I made an exception with Indiana Jones and the Great Circle because of how great the game is. However, I just can't see myself doing the same thing with other releases moving forward, unless a game gets a huge discount, and even then, I'm still unsure, to be honest. If I'm going to spend $70 on a game, then the entire game's data needs to be available on the disc or cartridge. Not everyone has access to a fast reliable Internet speed. Even if that was the case, you can lose the digital download or downloads at the company's discretion.

I was talking to a friend of mine yesterday and we had a lengthy discussion regarding future consoles and physical media. He thinks that video game consoles will eventually become obsolete, which I don't think is going to happen. There's going to be more diversity when it comes to gaming options such as, PC gaming, cloud gaming, and mobile gaming, but consoles will always be there. Playstation, Xbox, and Nintendo account for around 47% of the gaming market, not including PC's and mobile devices. That's a huge chunk of the gaming industry. I don't think that consoles will ever go the way of the dodo, so to speak.

Instead, what will end up happening, is that consoles will be strictly digital only. There won't even be an option to purchase a separate disc drive like you could with the PS5 Pro. It's unfortunate that the gaming industry is in the state that it's currently in. Look at the Nintendo Switch 2 as an example. From what I've heard, all Nintendo first party releases will only come with Game-Key Cards to download the games. On the other hand, third party titles will be available on physical cartridges. When  it comes to physical media, there's Strictly Limited Games, Fangamer, and Limited Run Games (which people have had issues with, me included). It's unfortunate that video game preservation has taken a back seat to questionable business decisions and corporate greed. What are your thoughts and opinions?",1,not_applicable

Tired finding people building stuff,"I'm just tired finding people that are building businesses, enterprises, working on interesting projects, etc

Most people I connect with are strolling on an idea and have never even reached out to a potential users to pursue that. They literally have no clue what they want to do, but just have this idea because it's cool nowadays to run a business or call themselves and entrepreneur.

It's just so exhausting that wherever I go, it's just some people with preposterous beliefs stuck in one situation. Tried joining communities, groups, clubs, it's the same shit.

For context, I'm trying to build enterprise software for service based SMEs and waste management businesses. I've looked for many ambitious, even people that just like building, but failed. 

I have a knack of building projects and with cool people. So, here I am posting with no expectations asking - if anyone's actually building something and don't just have an idea, please reach out. I'd love to help y'all(in my capacity), we can chat things, brainstorm different solutions(I'm good with sales and can help y'all get more customers), maybe even collaborate on projects.

10 Best Gaming Laptops,"Gaming laptops in 2025 have evolved to offer desktop-level performance in sleek, portable designs. Whether you're a casual gamer or a professional content creator, there's a machine tailored to your needs.

# Key Considerations When Choosing a Gaming Laptop

* **GPU**: For casual gaming, consider RTX 3050 or AMD Radeon RX 6600. For mainstream gaming, RTX 3070 or 3080. Enthusiasts should look at RTX 4080 or higher.
* **CPU**: AMD Ryzen 5 or Intel Core i5 (12th Gen or newer) are great for gaming. Upgrade to Ryzen 7 or Intel Core i7 for multitasking and content creation.
* **RAM**: 16GB is ideal for modern games. Opt for 32GB if you plan to stream or run resource-intensive applications.
* **Display**: A 144Hz refresh rate is beneficial for competitive gaming. IPS panels offer better color accuracy.
* **Storage**: A 512GB SSD is sufficient for most gamers. Consider 1TB or dual storage options for larger game libraries.
* **Portability vs. Power**: Thin-and-light laptops offer a balance between performance and portability.
* **Battery Life**: Gaming laptops generally have shorter battery life under load; expect to stay plugged in during extended sessions.
* **Cooling and Build Quality**: Efficient cooling systems prevent thermal throttling. Metal chassis are durable but heavier than plastic.

#  Here's a curated list of the top gaming laptops in 2025:

"B1/B2 Approved - Hyderabad, India - Sharing My Experience and What I Think Helped!","Hi everyone!

Just wanted to share that my B1/B2 visa was approved in Hyderabad today! I’m so relieved. The wait times were making me super anxious, and I wanted to share my experience and some things I think helped me get through it.

My timeline:

* DS-160 Submitted: December 15th
* Initial appointment date: May 10th (crazy, right?)
* Kept checking for earlier slots *constantly*
* Found an earlier slot: March 22nd
* Interview Date: March 22nd
* Approved: March 22nd!

Interview Experience:  
Was pretty straightforward. The officer asked me about my purpose of travel (visiting family), my job (Software Engineer), and who was paying for the trip (myself). He also asked about my ties to India. I answered honestly and provided documentation as requested (employment letter, bank statements, property deeds). It was all over in about 3 minutes!

Things I Think Helped (and some random advice):

* Honesty is Key: I was completely honest about everything. Don't try to embellish or hide anything.
* Clear and Concise Answers: Answer the questions directly and don't ramble. The officer doesn’t have much time.
* Strong Ties to Home Country: Demonstrate strong ties to India. Bring documentation to support this (property, job, family). I had all my documents ready, although they only asked for a few.
* Check for Appointment Slots Constantly: Seriously, keep checking the website multiple times a day. Slots open up all the time. I've even heard of people using services to automate this process, but I didn't try that personally.
* Don't Panic: The whole process is stressful, but try to stay calm and confident. The officers can probably sense if you're nervous or trying to hide something.

Also, a friend of mine mentioned how she used Atlys to help fill out her forms super fast (her visa was also approved), claiming it pre-filled a lot of the information. I just did it manually, but if I had to do it again, I might have looked into that a bit more.

Huge thanks to this subreddit! Reading through other people's experiences really helped me prepare and know what to expect. Good luck to everyone else going through the process! I know it can be tough, but hang in there!

Crafting Animated Videos: Is Krikey AI the Modern Alternative to Vyond?,"If you're in the business of creating animated videos, you've likely heard of Vyond.

Their [collaborative video editing tools](https://www.krikey.ai/features/collaborative-video-editing) are a real plus.

Out of their MINDS !! How much has everyone else been quoted?,An estimate for replacing the notorious bubbles on the screen issue. $3000!? ,1,hardware
La méthode qui m'a permis de vaincre mon addiction aux écrans et à internet.,"Hello, everyone. I just created a Reddit account because I wanted to share with you what has helped me overcome my addiction to screens and the internet over the past six months. In the following, I will describe my journey and my method through different stages.  


(First of all, I should point out that this is my first time writing on Reddit. I have translated my text from French to English because I don't know if this is done automatically. I hope the translation is correct, and I apologise for forgetting to translate the title).



**Step 1: Know why you want to stop using screens and the internet**  


The first step may seem a little silly, but it's fundamental because many people want to stop surfing on screens but don't know why they want to do so, which prevents them from sticking with it in the long run.

Personally, I wanted to stop surfing because I was tired of being a zombie and not being able to think or concentrate for long periods of time. I had just started studying law and I absolutely had to pass my year. I also wanted to read a lot more books, educate myself more, learn to play the piano, get back into sport, etc. That's why I think it's important to take some time to write down your ideas so you really know what you'd like to do instead of using screens and the internet.



**Step 2: Reduce your phone use**  


In this second step, I'll tell you how I drastically reduced my phone use (I went from more than 6 hours a day to about 30 minutes).

I have to admit that this step was difficult because willpower alone is not enough, as screens and apps are designed to be addictive. I tried a lot of things over several months. For example, at first, I tried using the ‘iPhone Screen Time’ settings, but they were useless because they were far too easy to get around, as were the many apps that allow you to create blocks. I then tried a dumbphone, which was pretty good, but I couldn't do some essential things like use my bank, which requires the mobile app, carpool, use my train app because I travel a lot (and I can't always print my tickets), access my passwords and 2FA, and on top of that, using T9 had become tedious for talking to my friends and family.  


So I found another solution. I bought a Google Pixel and installed Family Link to block my apps, and I have to say that it works like a charm. There's no way to get around this parental control. For example, it's impossible to create another account on the device or reset it. So here's how to use and set up Family Link:  


1 - Connect your Google account to a parent Google account: this parent account can be the account of someone you know or an account you have created yourself. Set a very long password for this account (I personally set a password with 100 random characters, which is the maximum) and either give this password to someone you trust or write it down on a piece of paper and put it in a drawer.  


2 - Block the installation of apps from the Play Store: with the parent account, you can and should block the installation of apps from the Play Store, forcing the user to enter the long password you set for the parent account.  


3 - Block apps: With Family Link, you can block any app. To know which apps to block or not, I have divided them into three categories.

a) Unnecessary / banned apps (e.g. social media, YouTube, mobile games, artificial intelligence, films, TV series) : for these apps, you should block them entirely via the parent account and don't hesitate to also ban apps such as the calendar, notepad, dictionary and calculator, as you can replace them with physical objects that will help you detox (these objects are also more enjoyable to use).  


b) Apps you need to use once a day (e.g. Internet, email, news, online shops, etc.): These apps should also be blocked completely with Family Link, the only difference being that they can be used on a computer, which we will see how to do in the next step. Additional information: to block the web completely with Family Link, you must block the Google Chrome app as well as the Google app's web search.

c) Apps you always need (e.g. banking, Google Maps, train timetables, etc.): These are the apps you will leave on your phone because you need them throughout the day. Take the time to think about how useful each app is and whether you really need it, and beware of pitfalls. For example, I find Spotify very addictive, so I've banned it, and the same goes for WhatsApp because I find it crazy to be constantly in message groups, and since they added AI, it's become awful.

Here is a screenshot of the apps on my smartphone:

https://preview.redd.it/kqh3oh2zas0f1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=e1b04a638039d00de360844028ff46bbaa9bc712

You can see that I only have things that are necessary and useful to me throughout the day, such as: the bank, Google Maps, my train app, my carpooling app, Bitwarden for passwords, Google Drive for sharing files with my computer and opening PDFs, Idagio for classical music, messages, photos and a podcast app, because I find it very useful for learning and it's not addictive at all as there's no silly content on it.  


Apart from that, I use a paper diary to plan, a notepad to take notes, a paper dictionary to look up words, and I have a calculator, but I've never used it because I prefer to calculate in my head or on a piece of paper like we did when we were children.  


So I find Family Link to be the best compromise, as you can enjoy the benefits of technology and smartphones while completely hiding the drawbacks. However, I don't know if this is possible for those who have Android devices other than a Google Pixel, but at worst, you can find used Google Pixels that are inexpensive.



**Step 3: Reduce computer use**  


Once you've reduced your phone use, you need to reduce your computer use, because if you don't set limits on your computer, you'll just transfer your addiction from your phone to your computer. That's what happened to me at first: I spent hours surfing the internet and watching nonsense even when I wasn't using my phone. So what can you do?  


The best solution is to use Cold Turkey Blocker software, which is fantastic because you can block everything, there are no loopholes and it is updated very often. It is available on Windows and Mac, and I recommend getting the paid version (which I think costs £35) because it blocks apps, whereas the free version only blocks websites. Once you've installed the software and figured out how to use it, you'll see that you can block apps in different ways, such as by setting a timer, a password or a random text to enter, which I find most effective.

Then, as with Family Link, you can classify apps into three categories:  


a) Unnecessary / banned apps: for this category, you will create a block in Cold Turkey Blocker to prevent you from accessing them. Personally, I have a block of 3,000 random characters, so I can't do anything and it would take me too long to unblock it. In this category, I put apps that I don't use and can't uninstall (I'm on a Mac), such as music, the stock market, Apple TV, etc.

b) Apps you need to use once a day: here, you also create a block and put your apps in it. Personally, I have a 1,200-character block with Mail, Safari and the App Store, which I unlock once a day in the evening for about an hour. Generally, when it's unlocked, I read the newspaper, check my emails, sometimes make an online purchase, do the research I've noted down during the day, etc. Tip: to force yourself not to stay on the internet for too long once the block is unlocked, I recommend enabling the ‘automatic start’ option in Cold Turkey, which allows you to set a timer. Be sure to do this to set a time limit based on what you have to do. Here is a video to show you where to find the option.

https://reddit.com/link/1kmlwv7/video/lvtd5d03bs0f1/player

c) Apps you always need: just like with your phone, you only leave the apps you need throughout the day unlocked. Here is a screenshot of the apps on my computer.

https://reddit.com/link/1kmlwv7/video/m9xraxf8bs0f1/player

As you can see, it only has what you need on a daily basis and works perfectly because I only access the apps in category ‘b’ once a day (App Store, Safari and email).



**Step 4: Reduce your use of other screens**

Once you've reduced your phone and computer use, it's important to reduce your use of other screens. To do this, simply get rid of unnecessary electronic devices. For example, I don't think it's necessary to have a TV, tablet, video game consoles, etc. at home. If you live with your parents, it may be more complicated to ask them to get rid of the TV, so it's up to you to convince them. As for me, I live alone, so I don't have this problem and therefore only have two screens at home: my phone and my computer.



**Step 5: Enjoy life**  


Once you've done all this, you'll be able to enjoy life and rediscover your full potential. In any case, this method has worked wonders for me, as I only use my phone for essential things and only log on to my computer once a day. I admit that it will feel strange at first, and you will feel a great sense of loss and emptiness, but it is important to resist at the beginning, to find and do other activities (hence the importance of step 1).  


Personally, for the first few days, I was going round in circles and going completely crazy, but little by little I started doing lots of things. For example, in three months, I read more books than I had in my whole life, I started learning to play the piano, I started running in the morning, cooking all my meals, revising my lessons much more, going out with my friends, going to the theatre, learning Latin, going for walks, joining a public speaking club, enjoying boredom (yes, it's crazy, now I enjoy doing nothing and letting my thoughts wander through my mind) and sometimes I even find myself cleaning the house at 8 o'clock in the morning, it's incredible.  


But I think the biggest change for me is my ability to concentrate. I can now focus on a lesson for hours and learn entire pages fairly quickly without thinking about anything else. I almost feel like a superhero, when in reality I've just become a normal human being who has regained all their abilities.  


I hope this testimonial will help some of you.",0,-
How can I break the ice with my college friend.,"I (23 yo M) live in a foreign city for job. I have completed my graduation in 2021 and started job rigjt after as a software developer.  Then I took admission in PG course in 2022. There I jave only 4 friends (2M and 2F). 
After I completed the PG in 2024 I moved to another city. We used to talk a lot in GC but was unable to meet. The two female friends always used to say that we should meet or should go on a trip.
One of them looks beautiful I'll call her Anna and other one is not that attractive Emily. 
In dec 2024 they both came to my current city for some university relayed work. They stayed with Anna's sister at her PG.
I had office so obviously I cannot meet them in day so they decided that we'll meet at night. We planned that we'll have drinks at my place and then I'll drop them back.
I don't drink but they both had some drinks and food at my place. It was really late at night so we decided that they'll stay here for night and then I'll get them a cab in morning. 
I have only one bed so I slept on bed and they slept on floor.
In morning when we woke up Emily goes to the bathroom and Anna and I are alone in the room. I offered her to cone to the bed as she was not comfortable at floor. Also it was a really cold day so she offered me her blanket.
We slept on same bed under a same blanket. 
But I thought if this was ny chance to come close to her (I'm still a virgin). So I asked her if she wants to cuddle but she said that she is uncomfortable so I asked again if I could just keep my hand on her while sleeping. She agrees on that. I put my arm on her shoulder and then started grabbing her hand. Then she said that she still feels uncomfortable so I removed my hand and stopped.
But then I again put my hand on her shoulder and we slept.
After we woke up I cam see some changes in her behavior,  she is not saying anything. I asked Emily if she's okay but she said that it's just her morning mood nothing to worry.
Then I got them cab and drop them safely. After then she called me to ask some money in urgent. I sent her the money. She returned the money next day and then immediately blocked me. I tried to mesaage and call her but started ignoring me.
At last I asked Emily to find what's wrong with Anna. She told me that she's hurt with that incident.  
I just don't had any intention to get physical with her but I just don't know how to talk to her now. Emily suggested me that Anna needs some time and everything will be okay. But now it's almost 6 months and we haven't talked. I just don't know what to do now. I really feel bad for loosing a good friend. ",1,not_applicable
My SSD keeps randomly(?) disappearing,"A while back I got a 500gb M.2 drive installed on my computer.  The goal was to just install windows on there and use my older SSD as my drive for everything (i used to have everything on it).  figured some extra space and less demand on the drive might be a good thing

Everything seemed to be working fine until one day my D drive (the ssd) decided to stop functioning.  It could no longer be detected by anything on the computer.  i thought it was dead but after disconnecting and giving it a look over it appeared again and worked just fine after reconnecting it.  a few weeks later it did it again.  Just to be safe i bought a new SATA cable and connected it to another port.  Same deal a few weeks later

I did some reading and i found out that having an M.2 means i should only connect particular SATA ports on the motherboard.  Well, it happened with all 6 ports on the motherboard.

clearly the drive is bad right? well my cousin loaned me his harddrive usb dock and it worked perfectly without any issues via USB.  hooked it back up via sata and it started doing it again.  But ive always been under the impression that you dont really want to be running software through usb

eventually i took the stuff i mostly use (a few games) and put those directly on my C drive so that i wouldnt have the issue, only using my D drive for ""nondemanding"" stuff - i noticed that the crashes tended to happen while doing taxing stuff like modern games or having lots of stuff running at same time.

yesterday i was actually talking to a friend about it when it crashed again mid conversation (i was playing an n64 emulator and streaming it via discord at the time)...and ive basically had enough

anybody have any idea what the heck could be causing this?

does this sound like the drive? motherboard? power issue?",1,hardware
Direction,"Howdy all!

I'll start with some background for context: My current job title is Systems Administrator. My employer moved everything out of their datacenters into azure, aws and oracle. The cloud infra side is mostly production software systems. Our windows infrastructure is being phased out pieces at a time with the eventual goal of hosting no more windows servers. The implications here is that my team's sole responsibility will be the 365 side. We manage our endpoints with intune, and manage the 365 tenant. I have a handful of CompTia certs, and I'm considering getting the md-102 and ms-102, but I would also like to eventually get into cloud security.

When looking at some of the exam topics for 365 and azure certs, i noticed some overlaps between 365 and azure for security. Do people usually specialize in securing one environment or the other do they work in both platforms? While it makes sense for me to continue down the m365 path given my current position, I don't care too much that a lot of the infra and other it fundamental stuff is abstracted away in 365 environments. I don't mind working in 365, and I feel like after working in it for about a year and a half that I am proficient in the platform, but it also can feel boring and building. maintaining and automating secure systems sounds more exciting than the SaaS world. Is this ""the grass looks greener on the other side?"" Should I stick with what know, and learn how to secure 365 environments exclusively, learn both platforms and how to secure them, or try moving over to azure and get the az-104 and az-500, opting to learn how to secure azure environments exclusively?",1,not_applicable

"Burnt Out, and Losing Hope. Is This Struggle Even Worth It?","I’m 23 and every day feels like a mental and emotional battle just to get out of bed. I feel numb. Nothing excites me anymore. I have no motivation — just a little discipline keeping me barely afloat.

* I never got into the university I really wanted.
* Ended up with a poor education.
* Graduated with a 3.01/4.0 GPA — not enough to get into any decent master’s programs abroad.
* Couldn’t find a job for months after graduation.
* Country I'm in barely has any IT jobs. It’s not a tech hub. Most dev roles require experience, and entry-level jobs are rare.
* The ones that *do* exist are swarmed with applicants or pay next to nothing.
* I see companies hiring foreign devs who accept insanely low salaries, making things even worse.
* Eventually, I gave up and took an IT Support job. It’s boring. I absolutely hate it I’ve been stuck in it for 1.5 years.
* I work 50 hours a week for $1k/month.

Now I’m trying to break into software development, but it feels impossible. My portfolio isn’t strong, and I don’t have the mental energy to keep up.
