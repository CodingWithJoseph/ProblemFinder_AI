Looking for a Projector within/around £300 in the UK for bedroom,"Hi BudgetProjectors!

I live in the UK in London and I'm looking for a home projector that i can use to watch movies/youtube/games in my bedroom with some flexibility  
  
We plan to get a portable stand so we can use it outside or at friends/family. It will mainly aim on a screen that is at a max distance of 4 Metres or closer and we havnt decided on the size of the screen yet but i think 110 inches is fine based on the rooms dimensions of 4.8m X 3.5m. 

Our Budget is around about £300-£400 more or less and dont mind getting things second hand or on sale.

I would like to connect a google stick or amazon stick or any other stick that allows me to watch things without needing pre-installed software that will most likely go out of date.

I dont know the price margins for 1080p/2k/4k, or the brightness/lumens ratios, or upscaling/downscaling capabilities for 4k content but I would like to have as much flexibility as reasonably possible.

With the research I've done so far I saw these projectors but unsure if they are good or not:  
PUTRIMS K12  
XGIMI MoGo 3 Pro  
XGIMI MoGo 2 Pro  
Nebula Capsule 3  
  
I saw some of these go on Sale recently and could of snagged the MoGo 3 Pro with a stand for £300 but didnt want to jump any gun!

Appreciate the help!",0,-
How bad is the 8 speed transmission of the 2017's?,"Hi there, looking at a 2017 Sienna AWD with about 65k miles (108k km)... I've read pre-february 2017 build date is worse than after... 

How bad are the transmission actually? To the point I'll definitely have issues? To avoid entirely? 

I've heard of a software reprogram, does that fix it for good? 

Also a TSB that gives an extended warranty... 

Anyhow, just wanted to know since it's a colleague who sells... Well priced and would be convenient in the timing and all. 

Thanks",1,hardware_only
Can You Actually Future-Proof a Supply Chain—Or Is That Just a Buzzword?,"**If I had a dollar for every time someone said their supply chain was “future-proof,” I’d have enough to buy a small fleet of refrigerated trucks and name each one after a buzzword from a vendor webinar.**

**Here’s the thing:**  
“Future-proof” sounds sexy in a strategy session. It looks sharp in slide decks, fits neatly in annual reports, and gives executives that warm, fuzzy feeling that *something* is under control.

But supply chains aren’t software. You can’t just “install” resilience and call it a day.

We live in a world where one ship gets stuck in one canal and half the planet ends up waiting for garden furniture. Where floods in Malaysia delay microchips in Detroit. Where a strike at a port you've never heard of suddenly derails your entire Q4.

But when you peel back the layers… can you *actually* future-proof a supply chain?

Short answer:  
**Not completely. You can’t future-proof a supply chain like it’s a VPN subscription.**

Longer, more useful answer:  
**You can’t stop disruption—but you** ***can*** **build a supply chain that knows how to flex instead of fractures.**

You can swap the dream of bulletproof logistics for the much smarter goal of being **shock-resistant, scenario-tested, and just unhinged enough to survive the unexpected.**

Let’s break down what “future-proofing” actually *means*—and how the companies doing it best aren’t trying to outrun disruption. They’re dancing with it.

**So why do companies keep getting caught off guard?**

Because most supply chains are built for *efficiency*, not *resilience*.

They’re optimised for:

* The fastest route
* The cheapest supplier
* The leanest inventory

Great when things are stable.  
Disastrous when they’re not.

**Future-proofing isn't about perfection. It's about preparation.**

It’s about building systems that say:

* “If this supplier goes dark, we already have a backup.”
* “If demand doubles overnight, our production line can flex.”
* “If freight costs spike, we’ve got visibility into better routes.”
* “If geopolitical chaos strikes, we’re not entirely reliant on one region.”

In other words:  
You may not know what’s coming. But you *know* something is—and you’ve already built in the shock absorbers.

**Here’s what that actually looks like in practice:**

🧠 **Multi-tier supply chain visibility**  
Not just knowing your supplier—but knowing *their* suppliers too.

📦 **Inventory agility, not just control**  
Buffer stock, regional warehouses, and demand-driven replenishment.

🌍 **Geographic diversification**  
No more “China + hope for the best.” Nearshoring and dual sourcing are the new risk insurance.

🚛 **Flexible logistics networks**  
Mixing in 3PLs, alternative modes, and dynamic routing to avoid bottlenecks.

📊 **Scenario modelling**  
Using AI and real-world data to plan “what if?” strategies before they become “oh no” situations.

**So, can you future-proof your** [**supply chain**](https://www.transportworks.com/)**?**

Not in the bulletproof, no-fail, crystal-ball sense.

But you can:

* Build for flexibility
* Design for disruption
* Train your team to adapt
* Use data to pivot faster than your competitors

And *that* is what separates the survivors from the companies writing crisis comms on a Friday night.",1,software_plus_external
Budget Mini PC for Obsidian and more,"Hey everyone,

I've been skimming over this subreddit to look for information about some mini PCs as I am looking for the best ""bang for a buck"" solution. Beforce anything, I am located in Germany and in best case, I plan to order from Amazon.

I've been DMing with my friends on an old Dell Inspiron 15 5000 Laptop, about 10 Years old. With some YT Music via BT in the background, Obsidian as my management software and a second screen for pushing pictures to the players, it starts doing some hiccups after about 1 hour of running. Especially during breaks when I lock the screen, it doesnt fire up again and I need to hard reset.  
I've been thinking on using a third screen in the setup, but that is a nogo as the laptop only provides one HDMI output.

While I know that a simple Chaatrey T9 or a BlackView MP80 would do the job just fine, you never know what ideas you come up with in the future with such a mini PC. Especially after I've seen benchmarks ( [https://www.cpubenchmark.net/compare/4943vs4949vs4749vs5299vs4867/AMD-Ryzen-5-6600H-vs-AMD-Ryzen-5-6600U-vs-AMD-Ryzen-7-6800H-vs-AMD-Ryzen-7-7800X3D-vs-AMD-Ryzen-9-6900HX](https://www.cpubenchmark.net/compare/4943vs4949vs4749vs5299vs4867/AMD-Ryzen-5-6600H-vs-AMD-Ryzen-5-6600U-vs-AMD-Ryzen-7-6800H-vs-AMD-Ryzen-7-7800X3D-vs-AMD-Ryzen-9-6900HX) ) of different CPUs, I discarded the idea of some Intel N95/N97/N100/N150 chips. (The 7800X3D is my desktop PC CPU for reference)

I am an enthusiast in PCs, been building my own and friends desktops for years now. While my cmd-skills do rely on try and error with research instead of knowing everything, I do know how to navigate and change settings in a bios and that you should reinstall the whole OS on such a Chinese Mini PC - with a clean Windows Image from Microsoft itself.

I came across the following Mini PCs during my research:  
[Beelink EQR6 Mini PC, AMD Ryzen 5 6600U](https://www.amazon.de/Beelink-Computer-16-500-Bluetooth/dp/B0B4D9K7LM?ie=UTF8&th=1) for about 349€

All are with applied coupons.

So... Instead of talking about the Pros as they are all kinda equal, I rather emphasize the cons on those machines:  
Beelink EQR 6  
\- 6600U is the worst CPU  
\- No fully-functional USB-C in terms of third display (although I've read somewhere that it \*does\* support it)  
\- I assume it is single RAM usage in delivered state

GMKtec  
\- nothing to complain about despite it not having the best CPU of them all

ACEMAGIC M1  
\- well... the malware thing although it is resolvable with clean install but...  
\- no driver support on their website for this device  
\- best CPU for under 400€  
\- According to my findings, only has single RAM installed, making it hardly underperforming. New set of RAM with 32 GB will cost about 70€ so we get near the higher equipped EQR6

If it ever comes to gaming, I assume it might only have to run something like Emulation up to Gamecube / PS3 (if only lower possible, no problem) and as I have a fable, maybe a Hoyoverse game. Although from my research, the GPU won't be able to handle those.

So I was hoping to get some good advice which to choose from. 

If there is a better system in the same price range, feel free to recommend it. Although it should be available in Germany.

  
So - thank you for reading up to here and thanks in advance for any recommendations.",1,hardware_primary
Musicians and Friends,"Being a musician (and founder) can be an incredibly lonely existence.

As a violinist for over 3 decades I've found making friends nearly impossible for most of my life. From practicing hours a day to become the best musician possible to finding communication with non-musicians difficult to painful, I've sought a better way to find friends for a very long time.

From the age of 10 through college, I was often the concertmaster of orchestras and that meant even further isolation due to either competitiveness, intimidation, or jealousy.

To add another layer to my loneliness, I've been a solo startup founder since the age of 19 and I had a policy of not befriending employees. At 30, I became a software developer and would often spend 80-100 hours per weeks programming. I also went through a 4.5 year divorce.

I'm one of the greatest inventors on our planet (invented Memorable) and I figured out how to solve one of the most important and painful problems we experience collectively as human beings: how to make friends in person for the rest of our life.

This is not a sales pitch as the company, Befriend, Inc. is registered as a nonprofit, our project is open source on Github, and what I'm developing is designed to be the antidote to decades of social disconnection, loneliness, and depression perpetuated through engagement-driven algorithms on platforms like Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, and even Reddit.

Befriend's purpose is for you and your kids to:

1. Never be without good friends
2. Never be stuck with friends for lack of better alternatives
3. Be able to make new friends as easily as ordering a ride share

You can personally solve this problem for the entire planet by helping Befriend execute a strategy for music artists to share the nonprofit platform with their fans as a way for them to be able to meet each other in person and real-time.

**In Person Matching**

a) We have a database of over 300k music artists aggregated from Music Brainz and populated with data from Spotify. [data.befriend.app/music/artists](https://data.befriend.app/music/artists)

b) Users can add their favorite music artists and rank them in the app

c) The app has a music artists filter where users can look for other users with a similar taste in music

d) Users can set a level of importance for each music artist filter (i.e. Taylor Swift - 9/10)

e) Our matching algorithm creates a score between each user based on a combination of this data

f) Our notification system sends notifications to users with the highest matching score first

**Musicians to Music Artists to Fans**

We are looking for musicians to help us spread our mission by reaching out to their personal favorite musicians to ask their fans and online followers to signup for the nonprofit Befriend app with the purpose of making friends with fellow fans in person and to finally solve this shared global problem once and for all!

Updated Rules and User Guidelines,"Hey everyone, it’s been a long time since I posted like this. To everyone new here, welcome to r/soulslikes! Since taking over, this sub has grown from a niche community where I interacted on *every* post, to one of the top 3% of communities of this kind on reddit, getting 3 million visitors each month. I am blown away by all your support, yet my intention of this subreddit still remains the same. To be a safe space for people to post and discuss their favourite genre.

With a community this size, we have recently begun receiving more feedback with regards to moderation decisions. In an effort to maximize fairness and consistency for our community, we have evaluated and updated the sub rules. 

These have been updated in the sidebar, and I will post additional commentary below them, to maximize transparency into the thinking behind these decisions. We believe this transparency is important, even as we remain realistic and understanding that opinions among individual community members may not always align completely. Post Flairs have been amended to account for some of these changes.  
  
The rules, effective immediately, are: 

***Rule 1: Posts Must Be Related to Soulslike/Soulslite Games***

* All games must have been either made by FromSoftware or be part of the soulslike/lite genre.
* Soulslikes are an evolving genre of game, and as such, decisions regarding individual games may at times be subject to mod discretion.
* Recommendations or discussion of games outside of the soulslike genre are allowed when the content is appropriately tied to the relevance of soulslike gaming and posted using appropriate flair.
* Posts seeking to engage primarily in political discussion are prohibited.



***Rule 2: Be Kind***

* *This rule encompasses and overshadows all others.*
* Insults and slurs will be removed and may result in a temporary or permanent ban.
* Conversation context will be considered, but user reports of posts or comments violating this rule will be addressed and considered seriously.
* Comment chains with multiple reports may be removed entirely. Don’t get caught up in arguments -- report the comment and allow the mods to handle it.



***Rule 3: No Low Effort Posts***

* *This rule encompasses and overshadows all others, bar Rule 2.*
* Posts must contain enough content to allow and encourage discussion and engagement between users.
* Game recommendation posts must include information such as games you have played in the past, what you enjoyed about them, and other detailed information to properly enable the community to assist you in a meaningful way. 
* Posts inciting discussion on a particular topic should make clear what the poster’s stance is on said topic.



***Rule 4: No Community Repetition***

* Redundant posts are subject to removal, we strongly encourage users to search and/or review recent posts before posting.
* Common sources of post repetition include, but are not limited to, game trailers, game opinions, choices between two games, etc.



***Rule 5: Provide Game Identification***

* Every post primarily focused on a particular game or games must identify the game(s) in the post title.



***Rule 6: Provide Spoiler Tags***

* During the first month following a game's launch, any relevant content posted from or about the game must have the spoiler tag enabled.
* Please err on the side of caution in this time period and utilize spoiler tags if at all in doubt.



***Rule 7: Meta Posts and Mod Interaction***

* Meta posts or comments regarding the subreddit itself, moderation decisions, or other non-soulslike topics at large, are prohibited.
* Moderators may make such meta posts at their discretion, and any comments or discussion in such threads are exempt from this rule.
* If you feel a meta topic of discussion is important or for any other reason need to communicate with the moderation team, please reach out to the moderators directly via modmail. DO NOT message individual moderators directly.



With the rules out of the way, here are some additional considerations and information pertaining to some of these rules that may help provide additional context:

**Regarding ""FromSoftware"" games being universally allowed:**

We have received comments that allowing content regarding all FromSoftware games to be posted allows for games like AC6, Kings Field & Nightreign to be discussed as well as other potential non-soulslike games. While this loophole exists, we believe the majority of the community agrees with the additional latitude we allow for FromSoftware titles as the company who birthed the genre. FromSoftware itself is hopelessly entwined with the definition and culture of soulslikes. Users still retain the power to upvote, downvote, or completely ignore any and all posts based on their own personal level of engagement with the given content.

**Regarding ""Non-Soulslike"" Games (or those that are debatably so):**  
  
As gamers, we are always looking for we think we would like and with soulslikes being so few and far between, we are happy (and encourage) users to discuss games you think soulslike fans will like, that are outside the genre (Claire 33 as a recent example). That said, these will be heavily monitored: They must be tagged correctly ('Not A Soulslike, But...') to set a reader’s expectations and the focus on the post must be why a soulslike fan will like the game. Due to the addition to the rule, the monthly stickied post will be removed going forward.

**Regarding ""Mod Discretion"" regarding ""what is or is not a soulslike"":**

This isn’t something that is taken lightly, but sometimes we only have users, trailers, steam tags and reviews to go off. We sadly cannot ensure that moderators will have sufficient coverage, time, or access to play every new game at launch. We will do our best to remain flexible as changes occur in and around the genre of soulslikes and will do our best to fairly evaluate games and content as these things occur. If you feel that there is any need to communicate disagreement with any of these decisions or to discuss specific meta-related discussions of a particular nature, please do no hesitate to reach out via modmail and we will address your request accordingly.

**Regarding ""Low Effort Posts"" and ""Game Recommendations"":**

The specific rule relating to game recommendation posts has been merged into our rule regarding low effort posts. The primary issue we as moderators, and you in the community, have historically raised regarding these posts ultimately all boil down to game recommendation posts that are otherwise also in violation of our low effort content rules. 

Furthermore, we recognize that the weekly ""Game Recommendations"" thread has not sufficiently worked to address this issue. Instead, we have added a new flair ('Game Recs') which must be used to easily identify the post, so people can choose to engage or not.

In an effort to prevent issues we have seen in the past regarding these type of posts dominating our front page content (particularly in low effort format), we feel we will be better able to address these underlying issues while still providing our community with a great resource to explore and discover new games to enjoy by requiring quality standards on game recommendation posts as well as requiring that such posts be sufficiently limited to avoid undue repetition.

Game recommendation posts will be monitored *heavily* and we will continue to evaluate these posts as a whole in an ongoing manner. As a warning to users, post  asking for game recommendations need to provide more context than simply “what should I play next?”, ""should I play X or Y?"", or ""is X worth playing?"". We want to maximally ensure our community is in a position to guide users to games they will genuinely enjoy and appreciate, but doing so requires sufficient effort on the part of the person seeking the recommendation, as well.

**Regarding ""Community Repetition"":**

We have reworked and reworded the prior ""no excessive posting"" rule. In the past, users have been frustrated if their post was removed when another similar post has been retained (this happens most frequently when numerous users post news or other timely announcements in a nearly simultaneous manner). While we appreciate the frustration when a post is removed, we also need to balance the needs of the community and we can best accomplish that by ensuring topics of discussion are centralized and not spread across multiple posts (particularly in short frames of time which additionally clutters up the front page). The new rule clarifies that posts will be judged against community-wide content, not just against your own prior posts.

One of the main purposes of this rule is to assist in managing game recommendations. Last year, we only had 8,000 members and 2/3rds of the front page was the exact same question, leaving content that was dull and users who were not interested in assisting. The engagement these posts get nowadays, when managed properly, is genuinely very high. As such, we want to continue allowing game recommendation posts, but also ensure the onus is on the poster to see if their question has been asked already (and to make sure the question has enough details to not trigger the ""Low Effort"" rule).

Reasonable exceptions will be ignored by the mods (e.g. we expect an increase of posts during a new launch and are happy to allow this). Please understand that our goal is not to stifle user posts or discussion, but to do our best to cultivate the best quality discussions we can facilitate.



**Final Thoughts**



Thank you for being a part of our community of soulslike gamers. We're excited about the growth we have seen both in our sub here, but also in the genre as whole. It's an exciting time to be a part of the soulslike community and there's no shortage of great games on the horizon. Take care!

"34"" OLED/QD-OLED Monitor for 80:20 productivity/gaming work - any suggestions?","I'm looking for a 1440p high refresh rate monitor that works for both gaming and productivity in the split I mentioned.

HDR looks dull and washed out in every game I've tried... (The new AOC Q27G40XMN),"I recently bought the new AOC Q27G40XMN (1440p, Mini-LED, VA). This is my first experience with HDR at all. As far as I'm aware, the only calibration I can do in the monitor settings as far as HDR goes is adjusting the HDR Mode (I assume this means preset), which includes: DisplayHDR, HDR Picture, HDR Movie, and HDR Game. While in HDR, the only other picture settings I can configure are contrast (from 0-100, which is unavailable in DisplayHDR mode) and local dimming settings (off, low, medium, high). From my testing on HDR youtube videos (namely this one: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxnMg0I0LZM&ab\_channel=TFTCentral](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxnMg0I0LZM&ab_channel=TFTCentral) ), the ""HDR Game"" preset (which is also the default mode) with local dimming set to ""low"" seems to be the best, as anything above low local dimming removes too many details in dark scenery. The video looks gorgeous in HDR! Super black darks, super bright highlights. However, I have tested these games in HDR (confirmed that my Windows settings say ""HDR on"", my monitor settings say ""HDR Game"" to on, the games' settings say HDR is on, and the games are all in fullscreen):

Red Dead Redemption 2

Monster Hunter Wilds

Dragon's Dogma 2

Baldur's Gate 3

All these games tested in ""HDR Game"" mode with local dimming on low, contrast on 55 (these are the only PC games I own with HDR settings so far). They all looked very grey, dull, washed out. Worse than SDR.  Some of these titles are salvageable with shaders, but others looks better or the same in SDR. I'm very confused if I am missing calibration settings in some form of software or if I have a faulty monitor. But the HDR videos look sexy so idk. I have tried Nvidia filters as other posts suggest, but every single one makes me crash almost instantly sooo (which is a shame, some of them I enjoy...)

Reviving Omnivore: Measuring interest in re-hosting and maintaining Omnivore,"Hi! 
A lot of Obsidian users here used Omnivore, a beloved read-it-later service that was killed rapidly in a private buy-out.

I'm a developer interested in taking over / forking omnivore and re-hosting it as a service. 

It looks like a group of people have continued development on the open source version, which is great for developers, but my interest would be in hosting this version for non-developers to use, as a service. 

My main interests would be in:
- making it available as a cloud service again
- charging $1-$4 dollars to cover server costs or accepting donations, ideally the first because donations are unpredictable
- improving it continuously and solidifying the codebase along with the current work people are doing
- keeping all of my contributions open source
- intentful bug tracking and feature requests for the hosted version
- improving data export and portability, and other hosting options, so in the extreme event that it were killed again - users would not be left hanging (maybe even icloud support as an *option*)

I made a mailing list and a poll if you're interested and want to follow along:
https://omnivorenext.substack.com

About me:
I am a seasoned developer who has worked on every part of the stack at FAANG companies, startups, mid sized companies. I hate big tech, private equity, and how poor quality software has become. I know how to run a full fledged large-scale service well and would have fun doing this as a sort of farm-to-table software project and labor of love (for omnivore and obsidian!).

Samsung Odyssey+ Owners! Was this Headset ALWAYS Blurry? Was It Ever Really Sharp/In-focus?,"I own a bunch of HMDs but have had a real love/hate relationship with my Samsung Odyssey+ over the years. Today I dusted it off and plugged it in to see how it holds up today and was dismayed at how blurry the image is compared to all my other headsets. Much blurrier than I remembered it being.

Now, if you search for this issue, you'll find many posts from users who claim the picture on their Odyssey headsets USED to be much sharper and that something--Steam VR, Windows, WMR itself--changed along the way to cause the image to become blurrier than it used to be. There are several different proposed solutions but none that seem to actually fix the issue for a majority of users--myself very much included.

I know Samsung used some sort of special filter on the panel designed to eliminate the screen door effect, and that this definitely caused a certain level of blurriness particularly with objects that were farther away, which would seem to suggest that this was in fact, always an issue ... but still in my own memory and the memory of other users, it seems to have gotten much worse at some point. There are numerous pro reviews still available to read on the web and I don't remember most of them noting an issue with blurriness this severe, but maybe they just ... ignored it? 

So my question is: did we all just IMAGINE that the Samsung Odyssey+ looked a lot sharper at some point in the past and it was ALWAYS this blurry?

Or did something actually change in the software chain at some point to make this flaw a lot worse?",1,software_only

I'm just trying to get through life without too much chaos, while causing minimal harm :) I like occasional bits of silly fun - I'll grow up fully when I'm dead -, but I also know how to be serious - and life has not been suuuper kind to me these past few years, so I feel like a bit of an old man, even though I do not look like it. I'm definitely not a university student anymore - I can't relate to that mentality, do you understand me? I worked for 6 years after university in software development, but due to long-term illness I'm presently unemployed. I'm trying to get back into work, but I need to prioritise working on my health first. So I guess I'm a long-term investment, not a quick win :) Hence why I'm not on Tinder lol.

For certain, I don't 'want children', and I can't actually live with most pets. I just want a female partner. By all means stroke my head and call me a good boy if you want xD

I might be a giant nerd, but can I brag a little to offset that? I've been called 'cute' and 'handsome' by a number of women in the past :)) But am I your taste? Maybe - maybe not.

I'm not religious. I'm not very political - I have opinions of course, but I'm not an activist or whatever - at least not presently.

If you think I might make a good friend, or even a good boyfriend, feel free to take a chance on me :))

And if you're still not persuaded, then I wish you a good day or night, anyway!

First PC purchase,I’m a recently graduated engineering major who would like a desktop pc that could not only run CAD and FEA software but also be able to be used for gameplay. I would also like to attach a bamboo lab 3D printer in the future. What specs should I be looking for? This would be my first pc ever bought. I want it to last a good amount of time. What are some options for pre builds as well since I don’t really have time to build one? ,0,-
Randomly got a package in the mail,"So about half a year ago, I think in October, I got an update for my Galahad lcd AIO that killed the screen. 

The firmware the connect software tried to install didn’t play nice or something and since then I’ve had a dead lcd and have had to set the pump speed through the bios to get everything working. 

I had opened a support ticket trying to get some help and went through some troubleshooting steps with someone for about a week before communications just stopped. 
I attempted multiple emails afterwards as late as January with no reply so I had just given up. The AIO was working for its cooling purposes so it just didn’t look pretty anymore lol. 

Fast forward to today and I got a notice I had a package at my door. I open it and to my surprise it’s a Galahad 2 LCD..

After like 5 months of ghosting me Lian Li randomly sends me a replacement AIO. Searched my email and on Monday I had one from a Mike saying my request had been approved and dispatched and they sincerely apologize for the delay caused by a shortage of raw materials. 

So now I have a new AIO and no motivation to replace it atm lol",1,hardware_only
Is replacing employees with AI even economically possible?,"So, as of this day and age, it's becoming very apparent that some companies are slowly replacing individuals with AI. CEOs of these companies give long lectures (or e-mails in the case of Fiverr's CEO) about why AI employees are better, cheaper and ""more efficient"". And of course, there's no denying that a well-trained AI could do many things a lot better, which is even if you ignore the fact that AI is essentially just software and software can be improved substantially every day.  
  
However, if you look at the Industrial Revolution: it caused people to look for other types of jobs and created a lot of new jobs because someone needed to build, fix and operate those same machines. Now, with AI, we have essentially created an alternative to a human, so it is far different from a machine user in a manufacturing facility. The thing is, ultimately, the Industrial Revolution had a positive outcome for employees since many such jobs prior to machines were unhealthy and dangerous.  
But with AI, I don't think it can be like that. There have been two thoughts going through my head that make it seem like it is fundamentally impossible to have AI have all jobs.

1. If a CEO decides that having AI Agents is better and cheaper than having humans, then that only works if it remains small scale (i.e., only entry-level jobs or contractors). Why? If every CEO replaced all employees with AI, that would mean that eventually, none of these people that used to have jobs will be able to afford anything, let alone the product of that same CEO that just replaced *everything*. At the end of the day, economy is about people being able to afford things + companies being able to offer whatever a customer wants. By replacing all jobs with AI, wouldn't you completely destroy the economy as a whole?
2. On the flip side of that, the only reason why things cost money is because of... well... the fact that there are people who want to get rewarded for their efforts. However, if all of their jobs are replaced with AI as well, wouldn't that mean that at some point, all basic needs could be free?

I don't see a world where an economy could work if we, the (mostly) non-CEOs don't even have money to afford anything. Now, there is of course a discussion for a Universal Base Income (UBI) which would work for the small percentage that gets laid off before everything is essentially AI-based.

So, ultimately, assuming that my two points could be true, wouldn't AI be both the end of our economy as well as allowing us humans to just do whatever we want instead of having to work — so being extremely positive in the end? (Ignoring what the effect of not having to work could be.)",1,not_applicable

Advice on whether to take an SQL developer job.,"3 years experience (Web Development)
B.S. Comp Sci

Position Eliminated from last company in January. 

Ever since I got laid off or eliminated or whatever from my last job I’ve been looking for a new SWE role. I haven’t had a whole lot of luck. I’ve been shotgunning applications (around 2000). And been contacted by maybe 5-6 companies one of which I really liked and got to the final interview with last month and they went with someone with more experience in that particular stack. 

Here’s my dilemma I applied to an SQL developer job and I’ve had a few interviews and think I may get an offer. I also got contacted for another interview for a position at an org very closely associated with the one I had liked before but I expect their interview process to be very slow. So even if I got it I would have to make a decision on the SQL job first.

Would it be bad to take this SQL dev job assuming I get the offer? I’m torn because I don’t think I would enjoy the work as more development job. Additionally I’m scared my skills would suffer if I’m only using SQL and the companies other software they use. On the other hand it’s a job and the salary range is about 10k - 20k more than I made at my last job. It is also full remote which would be a bonus.

I’d appreciate any advice to help me think through this.

"1.5 Years of Unemployment: Lost, Learning and Looking for Direction","Hello everyone,

In this post, I want to share my 1.5 year period of unemployment, the mental challenges I faced and how I lost my direction. If you’re in a similar situation or have been through something like this before, please don’t leave without commenting. Your advice could be incredibly valuable to me.

I worked as a junior developer at a company for about 2.5 years. I was involved in a real-time object detection project written in C++, integrating Edge AI and IoT. Since it was a startup environment, there weren’t many employees so I had to deal with many different areas such as testing, benchmarking, profiler tools, CI/CD processes and documentation. Moreover, the senior developer (team lead) was unable to review my code or help to my technical growth due to the workload. Although I tried hard to improve and share what I learned with the team, I didn't receive the same level of feedback or collaboration in return.

After some time, the company decided to create its own Linux distribution using the Yocto Project. During this process, they had a deal with a consulting firm and I was tasked with supporting their work. Initially, I was responsible for defining the project requirements and communicating details about the necessary hardware, libraries, and tools. However, the consultancy was canceled shortly afterward, so I ended up handling the entire Yocto process alone. Then, I started learning Yocto, Linux and embedded systems on my own. I developed the necessary system structures for boards such as Raspberry Pi and NXP i.MX. The structure I developed is now used in thousands of devices in the field.

During my one-on-one meetings with the senior developer, I repeatedly expressed my desire to write more code and my need to improve my C++ skills. I also mentioned that I lacked an environment where I could grow. Each time, he told me we needed to finish the first version of the project (V1) and that he would help afterward. But as V1 turned into V1.1, then V1.2. 2.5 years passed and not much changed. During this time, I continued to improve my skills in the embedded Linux field on my own. In our final conversation, I told him that I was stuck technically and couldn’t make technical progress. He said there was nothing that could be done. At that point, I resigned because I couldn't take it anymore.

After resigning, I tried to improve myself in areas such as the Linux kernel, device drivers, U-Boot and DeviceTree. Although I had previously worked on configuring these topics but I hadn’t had the chance to write actual code for a real product.

Although I wasn’t good enough, I tried to contribute by working on open-source projects. I started actively contributing to the OpenEmbedded/Yocto community. I added Yocto support for some old boards and made others work with current versions. I worked on CVE, recipe updates and solving warnings/errors encountered in CI/CD processes.

I want to work on better projects and contribute more to the Linux kernel and Yocto. However, I struggle to contribute code because I have knowledge gaps in core areas such as C, C++, data structures and algorithms. While I have a wide range of knowledge, it is not deep enough.

Right now, I don’t know how to move forward. My mind is cluttered, and I’m not being productive. Not having someone to guide me makes things even harder. At 28 years old, I feel like I’m falling behind, and I feel like the time I’ve spent hasn’t been efficient. Despite having 2.5 years of work experience, I feel inadequate. I have so many gaps, and I’m mentally exhausted. I can’t make a proper plan for myself. I try to work, but I’m not sure if I’m being productive or doing the right things.

For the past 1.5 years, I’ve been applying and continue to apply for ""Embedded Linux Engineer"" positions but I haven’t received any positive responses. Some of my applications are focused on user-space C/C++ development and I think, I'm failing the interviews.

Here are some questions I have on my mind:

\- Is a 1.5–2 year gap a major disadvantage when looking for a job?

\- Is it possible to create a supportive environment instead of working alone? (I sent emails to nearly 100 developers contributing to the Linux kernel, expressing my willingness to volunteer in projects but I didn’t get any responses.)

\- What is the best strategy for overcoming my tendency to have knowledge in many areas but not in-depth understanding?

\- Which topics should I dive deeper into for the most benefit?

\- Am I making a mistake by focusing on multiple areas like C, C++, Yocto and the Linux kernel at the same time?

\- What kind of project ideas should I pursue that will both help me grow technically and increase my chances of finding a job?

\- Does my failure so far mean I’m just not good at software development?

\- I feel like I can’t do anything on my own. I struggle to make progress without a clear project or roadmap but I also can’t seem to create one. How can I break out of this cycle?

\- What’s the most important question I should be asking myself but haven’t yet?

Writing this feels like I’m pouring my heart out. I really feel lost. I want to move forward and find a way, but I don't know how. Advice from experienced people would mean a lot to me. Thank you for reading. I’m sorry for taking up your time. I hope I’ve been able to express myself clearly.

Is now a good time to get into car sales?,"I’ve been in sales for over a decade, mostly high end independent clothing stores where I made very good money; I would do over a million in sales in my sleep as it was a short sales cycle and I liked the business. 

Right now I’m in fine art selling at an art gallery and it’s awful due to inconsistency. Some months I’ll sell 175k, then nothing the next month, then the next month I’ll sell over 100k through financing, then crumbs for a few months, etc. I can make my whole month selling one piece, but last year that only happened on about five ups.

The cycle is longer but it’s also not the same as clothing, cars, or even watches because to me there’s less gratification of being seen *in* something and much less of a necessity as well. People may not need a Rolex or a 911 but those are areas where many people will buy what’s in their budget. People like to look at art but not necessarily pay to own it. 

I live very close to a car mall and have considered getting into car sales before. Theres a solid brand mix of luxury German, Toytoa, Honda, Subaru, Land Rover/Jag, and Porsche. Most of the higher tier brands command some car sales experience for applicants from what I’ve seen on Indeed, but I was thinking of getting into a volume store, especially if the pay plan is decent and I don’t have to work bell to bell. 

Tariffs, and unstable economy would usually mean hold onto what you have and stay put, but my savings is rapidly depleting and I will be in bad shape if I don’t turn things around very soon. I’m really not qualified for much else, and software sales or something similar would require me to relocate.

From Infrastructure to Influence: How Dacxi Chain Is Redefining the Power Structures of Global Capit,"https://preview.redd.it/ct62hhx7it0f1.png?width=1120&format=png&auto=webp&s=24ff2912c4b63a81d73c48bef037f37833f2f15d

The story of global equity crowdfunding is often told through the lens of regulation, democratization, and technology. But that story is incomplete. The real shift underway is structural — not just in how capital is raised, but in who controls the mechanisms of capital formation itself.

At the center of this shift is **Dacxi Chain**, not merely as a technological infrastructure, but as a **neutral, connective force that challenges the dominance of financial silos**. In the same way that open-source protocols disrupted proprietary software models, Dacxi Chain is quietly redrawing the map of capital flow — and with it, the global balance of economic opportunity.

# The Hidden Politics of Capital Access

Despite the rhetoric of globalization, capital remains stubbornly local. Gatekeepers — from regulators to institutional networks — still shape who gets funded and who gets left behind. The irony? In a digital-first world, a founder in Lagos can build a product for users in London, but may never get funded by investors in either.

That’s not a technology gap. It’s a structural one.

Dacxi Chain flips this equation by introducing a **shared protocol layer** that links national crowdfunding platforms into a **collaborative global marketplace**. But more importantly, it reconfigures power:

* **Platforms become nodes in a network, not islands**
* **Investors gain access to global deal flow, not just local pipelines**
* **Regulatory compliance becomes programmable, not prohibitive**

This is not a minor efficiency upgrade. It’s a reengineering of how economic influence is distributed.

# Capital Without Borders. Influence Without Bias.

In traditional systems, capital follows influence. Dacxi Chain reverses this. By embedding trust, identity, and compliance into its fabric, it allows capital to flow on the merit of the opportunity — not on the location of the founder or the connections of the lead investor.

Consider what that unlocks:

* A climate-tech startup in Indonesia can raise from retail investors in Germany and institutional backers in Canada.
* Diaspora communities can invest in local innovation without friction.
* Regulators can approve participation based on shared standards rather than reinventing oversight jurisdiction by jurisdiction.

This is more than financial plumbing. It’s a **redistribution of influence**, empowering regions, people, and platforms that have historically been excluded from early-stage investing.

# The Network Is the Market

Dacxi Chain’s most radical idea isn’t technical. It’s economic: **that the future market for private equity will be defined by the networks that distribute it — not the institutions that guard it.**

In this model:

* Trust isn’t brokered, it’s embedded
* Verification isn’t paper-based, it’s interoperable
* Governance isn’t an afterthought, it’s automated

In effect, Dacxi Chain doesn’t just make equity crowdfunding borderless — it makes it **platformless**. Any regulated local platform plugged into the network gains access to global liquidity, reputation systems, governance tooling, and investor networks — while retaining sovereignty over their own deals and community.

This is a far cry from the top-down models of fintech expansion. It’s **bottom-up globalization** — one where innovation travels through protocol, not power.

# The Future Is Federated

As global capital markets evolve, centralization is no longer the endgame. What’s emerging instead is a federated model of trust and access — one where infrastructure is shared, but relationships are local; where platforms co-own rather than compete for distribution.

Dacxi Chain, in this light, isn’t a product. It’s a **paradigm**. It replaces friction with federation. And in doing so, it offers a rare thing in global finance: **a protocol that empowers without colonizing**.

# A Call to Builders, Not Just Investors

If the internet age taught us anything, it’s that the systems we build define the futures we get. Dacxi Chain represents an opportunity — not just for investment, but for participation in the design of a new capital market.

It invites local platforms to link up, regulators to lean in, and investors to look beyond borders. Not in search of the next unicorn, but in service of a global economy that allocates capital based on **potential, not privilege**.",0,-

After some time, the company decided to create its own Linux distribution using the Yocto Project. During this process, they had a deal with a consulting firm and I was tasked with supporting their work. Initially,  I was responsible for defining the project requirements and communicating details about the necessary hardware, libraries, and tools. However, the consultancy was canceled shortly afterward, so I ended up handling the entire Yocto process alone. Then, I started learning Yocto, Linux and embedded systems on my own. I developed the necessary system structures for boards such as  Raspberry Pi and NXP i.MX. The structure I developed is now used in thousands of devices in the field.

During my one-on-one meetings with the senior developer, I repeatedly expressed my desire to write more code and my need to improve my C++ skills. I also mentioned that I lacked an environment where I could grow. Each time, he told me we needed to finish the first version of the project (V1) and that he would help afterward. But as V1 turned into V1.1, then V1.2. 2.5 years passed and not much changed. During this time, I continued to improve my skills in the embedded Linux field on my own. In our final conversation, I told him that I was stuck technically and couldn’t make technical progress. He said there was nothing that could be done. At that point, I resigned because I couldn't take it anymore.

After resigning, I tried to improve myself in areas such as the Linux kernel, device drivers, U-Boot and DeviceTree. Although I had previously worked on configuring these topics but I hadn’t had the chance to write actual code for a real product.

Although I wasn’t good enough, I tried to contribute by working on open-source projects. I started actively contributing to the OpenEmbedded/Yocto community. I added Yocto support for some old boards and made others work with current versions. I worked on CVE, recipe updates and solving warnings/errors encountered in CI/CD processes.

I want to work on better projects and contribute more to the Linux kernel and Yocto. However, I struggle to contribute code because I have knowledge gaps in core areas such as C, C++, data structures and algorithms. While I have a wide range of knowledge, it is not deep enough.

Right now, I don’t know how to move forward. My mind is cluttered, and I’m not being productive. Not having someone to guide me makes things even harder. At 28 years old, I feel like I’m falling behind, and I feel like the time I’ve spent hasn’t been efficient. Despite having 2.5 years of work experience, I feel inadequate. I have so many gaps, and I’m mentally exhausted. I can’t make a proper plan for myself. I try to work, but I’m not sure if I’m being productive or doing the right things.

For the past 1.5 years, I’ve been applying and continue to apply for ""Embedded Linux Engineer"" positions but I haven’t received any positive responses. Some of my applications are focused on user-space C/C++ development and I think, I'm failing the interviews.

Here are some questions I have on my mind:

\- Is a 1.5–2 year gap a major disadvantage when looking for a job?

\- Is it possible to create a supportive environment instead of working alone? (I sent emails to nearly 100 developers contributing to the Linux kernel, expressing my willingness to volunteer in projects but I didn’t get any responses.)

\- What is the best strategy for overcoming my tendency to have knowledge in many areas but not in-depth understanding?

\- Which topics should I dive deeper into for the most benefit?

\- Am I making a mistake by focusing on multiple areas like C, C++, Yocto and the Linux kernel at the same time?

\- What kind of project ideas should I pursue that will both help me grow technically and increase my chances of finding a job?

\- Does my failure so far mean I’m just not good at software development?

\- I feel like I can’t do anything on my own. I struggle to make progress without a clear project or roadmap but I also can’t seem to create one. How can I break out of this cycle?

\- What’s the most important question I should be asking myself but haven’t yet?

Writing this feels like I’m pouring my heart out. I really feel lost. I want to move forward and find a way, but I don't know how. Advice from experienced people would mean a lot to me. Thank you for reading. I’m sorry for taking up your time. I hope I’ve been able to express myself clearly.

Note: I haven’t been able to do anything for the past five months and have been in deep depression. However, I applied to the “Linux Kernel Bug Fixing Summer” program hoping it would help me and it looks like I will most likely be accepted.",1,not_applicable

There’s a product backlog attached to the scrum board which gets updated and refined and the few days before new sprint starts we pick upcoming sprints goals from the backlog

I’m not sure what the best way to organize this would be since I’m new to Jira as well

Is this insane micromanaging? (rant),"Can I just check if I'm being crazy here, or if this is just normal, as I feel like I'm being gaslit by my boss here.

So I'm a senior software developer, I work for a software house, and am currently working on a project that I started 1 year ago from the first initial commit, to now where it is grossing £3.5m per year, and we haven't even really gotten started yet with scaling customers, so that number can scale a lot higher. We started selling the service just 2 months ago. As we're now making bank, the boss is taking more if a leading role in this project and is starting to pay more attention to it.

I am the sole dev on this project. I do front end, back end, DevOps, infrastructure, support, tests, documentation, project management, product ownership, the whole shebang. Literally everything you can conceive as a functional product in this business was built by my own hands, while our client handles the business side of things himself. I work frankly a ridiculous amount of hours, and am on call 24/7. (We did hire a dev a few weeks ago, but he has yet to contribute anything and is still learning the code base, he does seem to know his shit)

And to be clear, *I'm fine with this.* I get paid well. So it's worth sacrificing my life for this, and putting up with the bullshit that comes with this arrangement for at least a few years until I have enough money to have options.

However, this morning my boss rings me up and rants at me for not working correctly. He says, every unit of code I write from now on should be its own commit, and attached to its own work item on azure devops that is itself documented, and discussed with management beforehand. Every single unit of code. He is mad because, as a solo dev, I don't really have any need to commit very often. I'm not collaborating with anybody. so I usually commit full features. I.e, if there is a button that does a thing, I usually submit the front end, backend, and infrastructure requirements of that button as a single commit when its done. Which are themselves behind feature flags. He also wants to be able to see a daily progression of commits so we can have daily stand-ups to discuss the work I'm doing. He doesn't want me committing once per week with a big feature, because the volume of code I'm writing overwhelms him, and he can't be bothered to look over it at all (my code is also diligently commented, so it's obvious what everything is doing). So he's demanding I change my workflow, and day and structure it around a daily stand-up to make sure boxes are checked, and agile work items are linked together and documented instead of delivering... well, quite literally millions in value to our client.

That's insane, right? What do I do here...? Or am I being unreasonable? My boss is extremely stubborn, and always falls back to ""I've got x decades of experience in software, you don't, I know what's best"", when in reality his code is stoned college junior level, he's just a business man that manages companies. I feel like this is a totally wild expectation lumped on top of an already wild expectation that I be *every* tech department in this business. I don't really want to leave, the client and I have a super good relationship, and my options are superb. What I can I do to explain to him that helicoptering in occasionally and demanding I change my entire workflow is not the play? I feel like this will 3x any development time I have because I'll constantly be compartmentalizing work, and managing work items and documentation of each work item nobody is ever going to read in a thousand years.

New job requires to pay for invoicing. Can I opt out?,"So I have just started work for a delivery company as a self employed driver. 

After the whole process and getting the job, I was told I would have to use an invoice app to invoice the company. The invoicing costs £12.50 a week! £50 a month! Thats more than minimum wage and would take over 4 hours to pay for so bascially I am working the first 4 hours of a week for free to pay some company to allow me to have my wage.

The International EPD System selling licenses to consultancies?,"Does anyone have a list of who the consultancies are that purchased licenses to operate the different regions from the International EPD System?  Looking on their website (https://www.environdec.com/global-network/regional-partners), it's not obvious at all who these organizations are.

Asking since I'm just noticing that the North American licensee is WAP Sustainability, and many of the International EPD System's EPD for this region are also either by WAP Sustainability or using their EPD tool Theta.  These EPDs shouldn't be marketed as type III (i.e. third party verified), since they don't meet the ISO 14025 requirements due to the program operator (WAP Sustainability) is also the consultant performing the EPD, the data/software provider, and also hand picking the verifiers.  This is similar to the EPD Hub, who are operated by OneClick who also provides the data/software and selects the verified.

Too bad the International EPD System is selling out like this, they used to be looked at as a leader in the EPD field.",1,not_applicable
Using Simulink + Embedded Coder with ZCU106 (Zynq Ultrascale+ MPSoC) – Do I Need Vitis for ARM Targets?,"Hi all,

I'm starting out with the ZCU106 evaluation board (Zynq Ultrascale+ MPSoC) and looking to use a model-based design approach with Simulink and Embedded Coder — targeting the ARM cores only (Cortex-A53 or R5).

My initial goal is simple: build a basic “Hello World” app, like toggling an LED via GPIO, using auto-generated C code from Simulink.

I’m not planning to touch the PL/FPGA fabric (at least for now), so ideally I’d like to avoid VHDL/HDL workflows entirely.

That said, I’m finding it unclear what’s actually required to get this flow working:

* Do I need to install Xilinx Vitis (or SDK) to deploy code to the ARM cores, or can Simulink + Embedded Coder handle this directly?
* Is Vitis Model Composer required for basic GPIO access, or is that only necessary when targeting the PL?
* Is this board even well supported for this kind of Simulink-based embedded development, or am I better off using a different Zynq board for a smoother experience?

If anyone has experience using Simulink with ZCU106 (or similar Zynq Ultrascale+ boards) purely on the embedded software side, I’d really appreciate your insights. Especially interested in knowing which add-ons/tools are *actually* needed to go from model to running code.

Vevor Smart 1 alternative software.,"I can't POSSIBLY be the only person that thinks the software Vevor includes with the Smart1 cutter is barely functional if not downright infuriating.

And their licensing limitations are enough to tick off the pope...

I ran into a need for a 2nd install, one for my laptop, and one for my desktop.  (that way I can plug my laptop into the docking station / KVM and just print and cut without having to move files around, but no Exact Cut can't be bought separately, and I have no need for a 2nd machine, which has been out of stock for a while, perhaps discontinued I don't know... Hopefully not. I actually like the machine, it is the software that blows chunks.

Anyway I found that Easy Cut Studio 6 has added support for the Vevor Smart1. [https://www.easycutstudio.com/](https://www.easycutstudio.com/)  If you look at their compatibility matrix, which is HUGE, so use the find function in your browser for Smart and you will find it quick...

License isn't terribly costly and it is a perpetual license, no stupid subscription to the software... 

I have it installed in my desktop and need to dive deep into it, but for now, looks good so far.

Hopefully this helps someone else out.

Temp + Humidity Sensor for Horse Blankets using LoRa. Can I build this with minimal engineering experience?,"Hi everyone! I'm trying to make a prototype for a simple, rugged temperature + humidity sensor that attaches to a horse blanket to monitor comfort and overheating. So far what makes the most sense is transmitting data via LoRa to a gateway nearby. I want to log temps throughout the day and check them remotely.

The long term goal is to basically have an ecobee type setup but for a horse's temperature. Sensor, Gateway, App that alerts you if your horse is too hot/humid.

I have very little electronics experience, but I'm comfortable learning and tinkering. Here's what I’ve gathered so far that I might need:

Sensor Node (on the blanket):

* XIAO ESP32S3 or XIAO nRF52840
* Wio-E5 / Wio-SX1262 module (for LoRa)
* Sensirion sensor for temp + humidity
* Small battery (but I need a safe solution for horses laying/rolling. No blanket fires)
* Protoboard, wires, safe casing

Gateway:

* Something like a RAKwireless LoRa gateway or ESP32 with LoRa module near the barn

Software: 

* Arduino IDE
* Something for alerts/notifs. Meshtastic???
* Mobile app/dashboard

My main goals:

* Keep it compact and rugged (horses roll, lie down, etc.)
* Transmit readings every 30-60 minutes
* Looooong battery life.. Weeks?
* Avoid overcomplicating with too much engineering or surface-mount work to start off

Questions:

1. Is this realistic for a beginner with basic Arduino and soldering knowledge?
2. Is the XIAO + Wio combo a good choice? Or would an all in one board be smarter?
3. Any battery/power suggestions that are horse safe and fit in a small case?
4. Am I missing anything big from this build?

Would love any thoughts, sanity checks, or advice. I'm just looking to have a prototype ready before the winter. It doesn't have to be high tech by any means. Just record temp data inside the blanket and transmit it somewhere so I can read it. Once I figure out it's even possible I can complicate it then.

Thanks so much!",1,software_plus_hardware
Entry Level Roles Are A Dime A Dozen,"I’ve noticed how brutal the entry-level developer job market is, there are barely any entry level positions, every role you find is swamped with 200+ applicants, and you hear crickets after sending your resume on LinkedIn or Indeed.

I felt that frustration a few months ago, until I switched to a three-step playbook that got me a couple more interviews in just two weeks: first, stop applying everywhere and laser-focus on the few entry-level roles that actually match your skills—whether that’s JavaScript frameworks or basic SQL etc... I like to use revers search google method:

site:jobs.lever.co ""software developer""  apply.workable.com ""software developer "" jobs.ashbyhq.com ""software developer"" boards.greenhouse.io ""software developer""

Just change the job title to whatever you're looking for. Then on Google, click “Tools” and set the date filter to “Past week”. That way, you’re only seeing jobs that were just posted for this.  This should help you find more entry level roles.

I highly recommend taking an additional step further and finding out the recruiter or ""talent acquisition specialist"" of each job listing on linkedIN and reaching out to them via email or cold dm'. I use the tool getprospect for that.

This is a lot of extra steps just to get your application seen but that's the job market now and that's what you gotta do. I got tired of doing this and built a system that automates a lot of it, let me know if that works.",1,software_only

Cursor's ban of Indian students have wide reaching consequences,"What’s happening with the Cursor ban isn’t just about one app—it’s a reflection of a deeper, more uncomfortable truth that’s starting to catch up with us. We love calling ourselves a tech superpower, we keep saying India is leading the charge in AI and software, but actions like this quietly tell a different story. When a promising AI tool like Cursor, used by developers and students worldwide, suddenly starts blocking Indian users—especially students—without any explanation, it hits differently. It chips away at something bigger than just access. It chips away at belief. At competitiveness. At our future.

Because while we’re being locked out, students in other parts of the world—some barely in high school—are already integrating these tools into their learning. They’re writing better code, faster. They’re building AI-native workflows, experimenting, launching side projects, and becoming future-ready. And on the other side, you have Indian students—just as talented, just as hungry—forced to scavenge for offline alternatives or patchy workarounds because Cursor now sees an Indian IP as a risk, not a contributor. The tragic part? It’s not because of a lack of talent. It’s not even about infrastructure. It’s about trust. And that trust is something we, as a community, have slowly eroded.

Let’s be brutally honest with ourselves—how many times have we seen Telegram groups sharing “free methods” to get premium software? Fake .edu emails, VPNs to spoof regions, creating disposable accounts just to milk a trial plan. We call it “jugaad” like it’s clever. But to the people building these tools, it looks like abuse. And when enough of that comes from one region, it’s easier to block than to fix. The cost of that blunt decision, though, falls on everyone—including the honest ones. The aspiring student in tier-2 India trying to build something new. The college kid burning midnight oil on a project. The curious teen learning to code for the first time. They’re all being denied access to the same tools their peers abroad are freely using—not because they did anything wrong, but because someone else did. And the worst part? We’re getting used to it.

Imagine a 19-year-old in Germany building production-ready apps with Cursor’s AI pair programming, while her counterpart in India is stuck fiddling with old-school setups, constantly being told: ""this feature isn’t available in your region."" That’s how the gap begins—not with big headlines or economic shifts, but with small, repeated exclusions. One tool. One ban. One lost opportunity at a time. And if we keep going like this, we’re not just missing out on cool features—we’re locking ourselves out of the future.

This isn’t just about Cursor. It’s about our identity in the global tech world. Do we want to be known as innovators, or as a region companies quietly restrict? We have the numbers, the intelligence, the drive—but we also need accountability. If we don’t start calling out this culture of exploiting every system until it breaks, we’re going to keep losing access, and worse—respect. It’s not too late to change that. But it starts with us. With how we behave, how we educate each other, and how we treat the tools that shape our tomorrow.

Because if we don’t fix this, we’ll keep waking up to more silent bans, more locked features, and a world that keeps moving forward—without us.

Soon MHA graduate feeling unqualified....,"I’ve been at Children’s Hospital Colorado for 12 years and I’m working on transitioning into healthcare administration. I’ll be finishing my MHA this December. Lately, I’ve started looking at job postings that interest me, but it’s been tough to find something I’m qualified for without taking a big pay cut.

Over the years at Children’s, I’ve worked as an ophthalmic technician and was promoted three years ago to an ophthalmic educator. In that role, I handle onboarding, training, interviewing, policy alignment, and performance management—though I don’t technically have direct reports. I’ve also done clinical scheduling and a lot of hands-on patient care, but I’m ready to move away from anything patient-facing.

I’m really interested in roles related to project management, operations, or data analytics, but I don’t have certifications or experience in those areas. I’d love to get into that kind of work, but I'm feeling unqualified without any experience or knowledge of specific data/project software. I think I could get a clinical management position but this isn't what I'm looking for. Ayn recommendations on roles I should look for? Are there any easier project/data certifications that would help me break into the hospital administration field? ",1,not_applicable
"Opportunity in sales, how much would it change future opportunities?","Hello Everyone,

I have been on this sub a little while but decided to make a throwaway account to ask for some advice on an opportunity that was recently presented to me.

I graduated college exactly 1 year ago and have worked as a consultant for a software company since then. I’ve realized I am not overly thrilled about this type of work/industry but feel as if I am compensated greatly and have low stress overall which I am grateful for. I have had reservations for a while now as I had to relocate far from family/friends, move to a city I don’t like all that much, and have a feeling of existential dread when reflecting on life in the corporate world. However, I see those around me being given great opportunities when they move on from a role like mine. Top MBA/Masters programs, lucrative roles at startups, and more traditional roles in tech. As a result my working plan was to spend the next 5-6 years in my current company or consulting/tech generally (not sales) and then shoot for a top MBA program. If accepted, I’d like to take my chances as a professional/semi-professional poker player before and while in school as this is one of my passions. This additional education would come with the hopes of working in Management Consulting post-grad and or other more traditional post-MBA routes.

Recently an opportunity that interests me has come up but has also made me second guess my plans. A fully remote Account Representative role for a software company. The base pay is about $17k lower than my current role but with estimated commission of $30k-$50k. I have never done anything sales related and am concerned that I may have trouble leaving the sales world if I ever choose to do so. Do people end up siloed in this line of work or are there opportunities to pivot elsewhere if it doesn’t work out? My main concern is that while this immediately might be an improvement compensation and lifestyle wise, it could be a hinderance to opportunities in the future. Just looking for some advice on the world of sales and exits if I hate it? Also, does the lifestyle feel vastly different than say a data analyst at a large company or another business function that is typically 9-5?",1,not_applicable
Bangalore vs Berlin: Evaluating a tough choice between two solid offers 🇮🇳🇩🇪,"Hey everyone,

I’m a software engineer with approx 2.5 YOE trying to decide between two strong offers, but I’m struggling to evaluate them holistically — factoring in compensation, location, family life, and long-term growth. Would love your thoughts!

**Offer 1: Company A (Unicorn Startup – Bangalore, India)**

* **Role: SDE-2**
* **Compensation:** ₹30L fixed + ₹18L in stocks (4-year vesting)
* **Perks:** Indian startup with fast-paced growth, significant ownership in product
* **Family:** Easier to manage family support, no relocation stress

**Offer 2: Company B (FAANG – Berlin, Germany)**  
*(Already have this company on my resume)*

* **Role: SDE-1**
* **Compensation:** €68K fixed + €14K annual bonus + \~€1.8K in first-year stocks
* **Relocation Package:** €7K
* **Culture:** Better work-life balance, structured hours, global exposure

**My Dilemma:**  
I already hold the FAANG tag and have a relatively good standing. The Berlin offer looks attractive on paper for lifestyle and global experience, but the *salary isn’t a major upgrade*, especially when adjusted for cost of living and family expenses in Germany. Plus, I’ll have to relocate and figure out things from scratch. **I do not have a clear picture of how much will be my monthly expenses and will I be able to save enough, so please give me a brief idea about that?**

On the other hand, the Bangalore startup offer is aggressive in comp, offers me more financial growth (especially in INR), and allows me to stay close to family — which matters to me.

What would you prioritize in this case? Should I go for the international exposure and better WLB, or stick to the higher PPP-adjusted package in India with family stability?

Appreciate any honest feedback from those who’ve faced similar crossroads",1,not_applicable
"Have experience in software engineering and equipment validation, what roles can I apply to?","Hello,

I have a little over 2 years of experience as a fullstack software engineer as well as \~5 years of experience working as a validation specialist/engineer for medical device / biotech companies, specializing in equipment validation. 

For context, I did a bootcamp to career change into software engineering with a degree in chemical engineering. Currently unemployed since January

After some time thinking, it might be best for me to move on from continuing to be a software engineer and look into different roles. I would love to continue to work with technology in some capacity if possible. I have also thought about going back to my previous role.

I wanted to ask for some advice on what roles I can look into that could use both of my experiences here? From roles I've researched, a lot of them require years of experience where I don't think i have much relevant experience. 

Appreciate anyone's advice, thank you",1,not_applicable
Problem with Plustek scanner (or my lack of knowledge),"I wanted to dust off my hobby of film photography and went ahead to scan my first roll of film in a while. I have a Plustek 7200i scanner with the original SilverFast SE software for Windows.

A while ago, when I did my first scans, I would scan the film as negative and use the SilverFast software to do inversion for me and some preprocessing before editing the image in GIMP, but I was always a bit disappointed with the results.

This time I wanted to do everything by myself, so I set the scanner into positive-scanning mode, kept everything standard in the SilverFast software to do as little processing to the scan as possible and to just get the ""raw"" negative scanned (screenshot).

I did my scan, exported to rawTherapee, sampled white balance from the border (unexposed film) making it pretty much perfectly balanced RGB and exported that to GIMP. In GIMP I inverted the image and got the resulting image attatched. Mostly the white balance is good, but the reds are WAAAY off.

I sometimes have this impression that the silverfast software is unconsistent in its scans - I scan one image and then another one and they look like they were scanned with completely different settings. I change the settings, bring them back to where they were and it gives me a different looking image on the same settings!

Did anyone have this kind of problem? Am I doing something wrong? Is it the scanning software issue? Is it a hardware issue? Is it a (sobs) skill issue? Please help, how should I approach this?

Does leaving High paying job in India and moving to Germany worth it?,"Hey folks,

I’m currently working in India, earning around 22 LPA with 4 years of experience. My fiancée is also working and earning 30 LPA. We've been thinking about moving to Germany for a Master's in AI/ML Engineering, Computer science or Data Science, and we’d likely go together.

I’m genuinely interested in the field and keen to explore opportunities in Europe. However, I’m unsure whether it’s the right move financially and career-wise. We'd be giving up decent-paying jobs in India and spending 2 years studying, possibly working part-time during that period. Post-master’s, how would the situation look like?

Would love to hear your thoughts — especially from folks who’ve made a similar move or are working in AI/ML or software engineer in Germany.

Is it a good decision in the long run? Or should we continue in India where we already have stable careers?

my_qualifications and his: Btech in Computer science with 4 years of work experience 

I can learn German more in 2 years I have A1 right now.

Thanks in advance!",0,-
"Men of Reddit, what do you think is the best way to control your short temper and be wise?","Hey everyone. I request that all of you advise me on my situation and this would really change my life and I am really loojing to get better. I’m eager to make some positive changes and hope to hear your thoughts on navigating my current situation.

Allow me to introduce myself. I'm a 35M and I've spent the past 12 years as a software developer. I’m fortunate to be in a field that not only offers me a comfortable income but also allows me to channel my passion for technology and I WFH. My wife who works in a similar role within our industry also earns a good salary which contributes to our stable financial situation and she WFH too. Together we’re raising our energetic 3 year old son who brings joy and laughter to our lives every day.

I pride myself on my friendly nature. I’m always willing to lend a hand and support those around me especially when I notice someone in distress. I find it hard to witness others in pain as empathy is something I hold dear. Seeing someone in distress or pain deeply affects me. I cannot bear to witness sadness. In fact when I encounter situations where someone is bleeding or injured, I often feel overwhelmed and faint, a testament to my sensitivity. 

My family is my top priority and I dedicate a significant amount of my time and affection to them. I consciously choose to avoid spending money on frivolous items and instead focus on saving for my family's future especially for my son. Over the past few years I have worked tirelessly and diligently resulting in the successful payoff of a $500k mortgage. A milestone that brings me immense pride. At my core I am a family-oriented individual and I have very few friends. Only one or two have become more like family over the years. My greatest aspiration is to witness my loved ones flourish remaining healthy and happy as they navigate life. It brings me joy to invest in their well being and create an environment filled with love and support.

My main concern is my short temper. I get angry easily even over small things and it's making my life miserable. In those moments of anger I feel like I forget all my principles and afterward I regret my actions and feel filled with guilt. Sometimes things that won't matter in an hour drive me crazy leading to debates with my wife, mother, and brother who are everything to me. I feel guilty almost immediately within just five minutes of getting angry. This pattern happens every time. I get angry, say harsh words, and then shortly after I realize my mistakes and feel like a bad person for treating them poorly even though the damage has already been done. This is starting to impact my mental health. I genuinely want to show love and care to everyone around me and I don’t want to get angry but I seem unable to help it. I know that if I can control my short temper, I will become a better person and people will look up to me.

To clarify what I have done so far. I have visited a therapist several times and during our sessions I show no signs of anger. However when I am at home, if something hurts my ego or if someone tries to correct me, debate with me, or present a point that undermines mine, I can become extremely angry. If someone shows off in front of me or if I feel disrespected, I often lose control and react with anger. I usually feel bad about it within five minutes and apologize afterward. I have also participated in focus groups but the same pattern occurs. I manage to remain calm during the sessions but in the heat of the moment I forget everything and again react with rage. Recently I have been trying to listen to podcasts at a low volume through earbuds whenever I am around others. When I feel anger rising instead of reacting, I focus on the podcast, asking myself if this moment will matter to me in an hour. This helps me cool off. Additionally, when I'm overwhelmed with rage, I think about the possibility of someone dying at that moment and how I would regret letting my anger consume me. This thought often transforms my anger into a sense of love which helps but it's still difficult. Despite my efforts I continue to make mistakes. While these strategies help to some extent they don’t last long.

I am not sure what should I do? Help your brother here and I am willing to try everything I can. 

How can I be a person who is anger free and wise?",1,not_applicable
I Built CatDoes: Your Words to Native Apps,"# What is CatDoes?

[https://catdoes.com](https://catdoes.com) is a no-code AI app builder that transforms conversations into fully functional **native** mobile apps. You simply describe your app idea, and AI agents handle everything else from understanding the app's requirements to releasing on the app stores.

# How does it work?

CatDoes uses four specialized AI agents working together:

1. **Requirement Agent**: Understands your app's requirements and what features it needs, then passes it to the design agent.
2. **Design Agent**: Comes up with an appropriate user flow, what pages the app needs and how these pages interact with each other, along with an appropriate color palette for your app.
3. **Software Agent**: Knows how to code, and from the information that it has received from the first two agents, it starts building the app for you.
4. **Release Agent**: Prepares your app for releasing on Google Play and Apple's App Store. It's all conversational!

# Who is this for?

* **SMBs** looking to expand their digital presence
* **Startup founders** who need to quickly build an MVP and gather user feedback
* **UI/UX designers** wanting functional prototypes of their designs
* **Non-technical entrepreneurs** with app ideas but no coding skills
* **Anyone** for their specific needs(Personal apps)

# What makes CatDoes different?

Our platform is quite easy to use. Everything's conversational. Everyone who can type can make an app!

We're not focusing on one-shotting an app. We want to have a platform that allows you to maintain your app as well. Think you want to add a new feature down the road, or there's a new Android/iOS release and you want to make sure your app works fine with the new OS updates.

We have easy-to-use checkpoints called ""instances."" They're your conversation history + commit in one package. You start a new checkpoint, shape your app further, and if you don't like the outcome, you can roll back. Instances are stacked on top of each other. Meaning, the second instance is the continuation of the first instance.

# We've launched and we'd love to hear your feedback!

We're still refining our product and would love to hear your thoughts. What app would you build if coding wasn't an issue? Any features you'd want to see? I'm around to answer questions and would love your honest thoughts! Feel free to ask questions in the comments or DM me directly!

P.S. If you know anyone who's been sitting on an app idea, maybe tag them? I'd love to help more people build their ideas!",0,-
