Looking for a Projector within/around £300 in the UK for bedroom,"Hi BudgetProjectors!

I live in the UK in London and I'm looking for a home projector that i can use to watch movies/youtube/games in my bedroom with some flexibility  
  
We plan to get a portable stand so we can use it outside or at friends/family. It will mainly aim on a screen that is at a max distance of 4 Metres or closer and we havnt decided on the size of the screen yet but i think 110 inches is fine based on the rooms dimensions of 4.8m X 3.5m. 

Our Budget is around about £300-£400 more or less and dont mind getting things second hand or on sale.

I would like to connect a google stick or amazon stick or any other stick that allows me to watch things without needing pre-installed software that will most likely go out of date.

I dont know the price margins for 1080p/2k/4k, or the brightness/lumens ratios, or upscaling/downscaling capabilities for 4k content but I would like to have as much flexibility as reasonably possible.

With the research I've done so far I saw these projectors but unsure if they are good or not:  
PUTRIMS K12  
XGIMI MoGo 3 Pro  
XGIMI MoGo 2 Pro  
Nebula Capsule 3  
  
I saw some of these go on Sale recently and could of snagged the MoGo 3 Pro with a stand for £300 but didnt want to jump any gun!

Appreciate the help!",1,1,0,1,The post describes a problem of selecting a suitable projector within a specific budget and requirements.,"The problem is not primarily solvable through software, as it involves choosing a physical product based on hardware specifications and budget.","The solution requires external factors such as market availability, sales, and potentially purchasing from a retailer, which are beyond the user's direct control.",seeking_existing_solution,medium
How bad is the 8 speed transmission of the 2017's?,"Hi there, looking at a 2017 Sienna AWD with about 65k miles (108k km)... I've read pre-february 2017 build date is worse than after... 

How bad are the transmission actually? To the point I'll definitely have issues? To avoid entirely? 

I've heard of a software reprogram, does that fix it for good? 

Also a TSB that gives an extended warranty... 

Anyhow, just wanted to know since it's a colleague who sells... Well priced and would be convenient in the timing and all.

Can You Actually Future-Proof a Supply Chain—Or Is That Just a Buzzword?,"**If I had a dollar for every time someone said their supply chain was “future-proof,” I’d have enough to buy a small fleet of refrigerated trucks and name each one after a buzzword from a vendor webinar.**

**Here’s the thing:**  
“Future-proof” sounds sexy in a strategy session. It looks sharp in slide decks, fits neatly in annual reports, and gives executives that warm, fuzzy feeling that *something* is under control.

But supply chains aren’t software. You can’t just “install” resilience and call it a day.

We live in a world where one ship gets stuck in one canal and half the planet ends up waiting for garden furniture. Where floods in Malaysia delay microchips in Detroit. Where a strike at a port you've never heard of suddenly derails your entire Q4.

But when you peel back the layers… can you *actually* future-proof a supply chain?

Short answer:  
**Not completely. You can’t future-proof a supply chain like it’s a VPN subscription.**

Longer, more useful answer:  
**You can’t stop disruption—but you** ***can*** **build a supply chain that knows how to flex instead of fractures.**

You can swap the dream of bulletproof logistics for the much smarter goal of being **shock-resistant, scenario-tested, and just unhinged enough to survive the unexpected.**

Let’s break down what “future-proofing” actually *means*—and how the companies doing it best aren’t trying to outrun disruption. They’re dancing with it.

**So why do companies keep getting caught off guard?**

Because most supply chains are built for *efficiency*, not *resilience*.

They’re optimised for:

* The fastest route
* The cheapest supplier
* The leanest inventory

Great when things are stable.  
Disastrous when they’re not.

**Future-proofing isn't about perfection. It's about preparation.**

It’s about building systems that say:

* “If this supplier goes dark, we already have a backup.”
* “If demand doubles overnight, our production line can flex.”
* “If freight costs spike, we’ve got visibility into better routes.”
* “If geopolitical chaos strikes, we’re not entirely reliant on one region.”

In other words:  
You may not know what’s coming. But you *know* something is—and you’ve already built in the shock absorbers.

**Here’s what that actually looks like in practice:**

🧠 **Multi-tier supply chain visibility**  
Not just knowing your supplier—but knowing *their* suppliers too.

📦 **Inventory agility, not just control**  
Buffer stock, regional warehouses, and demand-driven replenishment.

🌍 **Geographic diversification**  
No more “China + hope for the best.” Nearshoring and dual sourcing are the new risk insurance.

🚛 **Flexible logistics networks**  
Mixing in 3PLs, alternative modes, and dynamic routing to avoid bottlenecks.

📊 **Scenario modelling**  
Using AI and real-world data to plan “what if?” strategies before they become “oh no” situations.

**So, can you future-proof your** [**supply chain**](https://www.transportworks.com/)**?**

Not in the bulletproof, no-fail, crystal-ball sense.

But you can:

* Build for flexibility
* Design for disruption
* Train your team to adapt
* Use data to pivot faster than your competitors

And *that* is what separates the survivors from the companies writing crisis comms on a Friday night.",4,1,0,1,"The post is a discussion about the concept of 'future-proofing' in supply chains, not a request for help or a description of a specific problem needing a solution.","Since there is no specific problem being addressed, there is no software solution applicable.","There is no specific problem requiring external action or coordination, as the post is a general discussion rather than a request for help.",learning_question,medium
Budget Mini PC for Obsidian and more,"Hey everyone,

I've been skimming over this subreddit to look for information about some mini PCs as I am looking for the best ""bang for a buck"" solution. Beforce anything, I am located in Germany and in best case, I plan to order from Amazon.

I've been DMing with my friends on an old Dell Inspiron 15 5000 Laptop, about 10 Years old. With some YT Music via BT in the background, Obsidian as my management software and a second screen for pushing pictures to the players, it starts doing some hiccups after about 1 hour of running. Especially during breaks when I lock the screen, it doesnt fire up again and I need to hard reset.  
I've been thinking on using a third screen in the setup, but that is a nogo as the laptop only provides one HDMI output.

While I know that a simple Chaatrey T9 or a BlackView MP80 would do the job just fine, you never know what ideas you come up with in the future with such a mini PC. Especially after I've seen benchmarks ( [https://www.cpubenchmark.net/compare/4943vs4949vs4749vs5299vs4867/AMD-Ryzen-5-6600H-vs-AMD-Ryzen-5-6600U-vs-AMD-Ryzen-7-6800H-vs-AMD-Ryzen-7-7800X3D-vs-AMD-Ryzen-9-6900HX](https://www.cpubenchmark.net/compare/4943vs4949vs4749vs5299vs4867/AMD-Ryzen-5-6600H-vs-AMD-Ryzen-5-6600U-vs-AMD-Ryzen-7-6800H-vs-AMD-Ryzen-7-7800X3D-vs-AMD-Ryzen-9-6900HX) ) of different CPUs, I discarded the idea of some Intel N95/N97/N100/N150 chips. (The 7800X3D is my desktop PC CPU for reference)

I am an enthusiast in PCs, been building my own and friends desktops for years now. While my cmd-skills do rely on try and error with research instead of knowing everything, I do know how to navigate and change settings in a bios and that you should reinstall the whole OS on such a Chinese Mini PC - with a clean Windows Image from Microsoft itself.

I came across the following Mini PCs during my research:  
[Beelink EQR6 Mini PC, AMD Ryzen 5 6600U](https://www.amazon.de/Beelink-Computer-16-500-Bluetooth/dp/B0B4D9K7LM?ie=UTF8&th=1) for about 349€

All are with applied coupons.

So... Instead of talking about the Pros as they are all kinda equal, I rather emphasize the cons on those machines:  
Beelink EQR 6  
\- 6600U is the worst CPU  
\- No fully-functional USB-C in terms of third display (although I've read somewhere that it \*does\* support it)  
\- I assume it is single RAM usage in delivered state

GMKtec  
\- nothing to complain about despite it not having the best CPU of them all

ACEMAGIC M1  
\- well... the malware thing although it is resolvable with clean install but...  
\- no driver support on their website for this device  
\- best CPU for under 400€  
\- According to my findings, only has single RAM installed, making it hardly underperforming. New set of RAM with 32 GB will cost about 70€ so we get near the higher equipped EQR6

If it ever comes to gaming, I assume it might only have to run something like Emulation up to Gamecube / PS3 (if only lower possible, no problem) and as I have a fable, maybe a Hoyoverse game. Although from my research, the GPU won't be able to handle those.

So I was hoping to get some good advice which to choose from. 

If there is a better system in the same price range, feel free to recommend it. Although it should be available in Germany.

  
So - thank you for reading up to here and thanks in advance for any recommendations.",1,1,0,1,The post describes a problem with the current laptop's performance and seeks advice on purchasing a new mini PC.,"The problem is primarily about hardware limitations and the need for a new device, which cannot be solved through software alone.","The solution involves purchasing a new mini PC, which requires external action such as buying from a retailer.","seeking_existing_solution, learning_question",medium
Musicians and Friends,"Being a musician (and founder) can be an incredibly lonely existence.

As a violinist for over 3 decades I've found making friends nearly impossible for most of my life. From practicing hours a day to become the best musician possible to finding communication with non-musicians difficult to painful, I've sought a better way to find friends for a very long time.

From the age of 10 through college, I was often the concertmaster of orchestras and that meant even further isolation due to either competitiveness, intimidation, or jealousy.

To add another layer to my loneliness, I've been a solo startup founder since the age of 19 and I had a policy of not befriending employees. At 30, I became a software developer and would often spend 80-100 hours per weeks programming. I also went through a 4.5 year divorce.

I'm one of the greatest inventors on our planet (invented Memorable) and I figured out how to solve one of the most important and painful problems we experience collectively as human beings: how to make friends in person for the rest of our life.

This is not a sales pitch as the company, Befriend, Inc. is registered as a nonprofit, our project is open source on Github, and what I'm developing is designed to be the antidote to decades of social disconnection, loneliness, and depression perpetuated through engagement-driven algorithms on platforms like Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, and even Reddit.

Befriend's purpose is for you and your kids to:

1. Never be without good friends
2. Never be stuck with friends for lack of better alternatives
3. Be able to make new friends as easily as ordering a ride share

You can personally solve this problem for the entire planet by helping Befriend execute a strategy for music artists to share the nonprofit platform with their fans as a way for them to be able to meet each other in person and real-time.

**In Person Matching**

a) We have a database of over 300k music artists aggregated from Music Brainz and populated with data from Spotify. [data.befriend.app/music/artists](https://data.befriend.app/music/artists)

b) Users can add their favorite music artists and rank them in the app

c) The app has a music artists filter where users can look for other users with a similar taste in music

d) Users can set a level of importance for each music artist filter (i.e. Taylor Swift - 9/10)

e) Our matching algorithm creates a score between each user based on a combination of this data

f) Our notification system sends notifications to users with the highest matching score first

**Musicians to Music Artists to Fans**

We are looking for musicians to help us spread our mission by reaching out to their personal favorite musicians to ask their fans and online followers to signup for the nonprofit Befriend app with the purpose of making friends with fellow fans in person and to finally solve this shared global problem once and for all!

Updated Rules and User Guidelines,"Hey everyone, it’s been a long time since I posted like this. To everyone new here, welcome to r/soulslikes! Since taking over, this sub has grown from a niche community where I interacted on *every* post, to one of the top 3% of communities of this kind on reddit, getting 3 million visitors each month. I am blown away by all your support, yet my intention of this subreddit still remains the same. To be a safe space for people to post and discuss their favourite genre.

With a community this size, we have recently begun receiving more feedback with regards to moderation decisions. In an effort to maximize fairness and consistency for our community, we have evaluated and updated the sub rules. 

These have been updated in the sidebar, and I will post additional commentary below them, to maximize transparency into the thinking behind these decisions. We believe this transparency is important, even as we remain realistic and understanding that opinions among individual community members may not always align completely. Post Flairs have been amended to account for some of these changes.  
  
The rules, effective immediately, are: 

***Rule 1: Posts Must Be Related to Soulslike/Soulslite Games***

* All games must have been either made by FromSoftware or be part of the soulslike/lite genre.
* Soulslikes are an evolving genre of game, and as such, decisions regarding individual games may at times be subject to mod discretion.
* Recommendations or discussion of games outside of the soulslike genre are allowed when the content is appropriately tied to the relevance of soulslike gaming and posted using appropriate flair.
* Posts seeking to engage primarily in political discussion are prohibited.



***Rule 2: Be Kind***

* *This rule encompasses and overshadows all others.*
* Insults and slurs will be removed and may result in a temporary or permanent ban.
* Conversation context will be considered, but user reports of posts or comments violating this rule will be addressed and considered seriously.
* Comment chains with multiple reports may be removed entirely. Don’t get caught up in arguments -- report the comment and allow the mods to handle it.



***Rule 3: No Low Effort Posts***

* *This rule encompasses and overshadows all others, bar Rule 2.*
* Posts must contain enough content to allow and encourage discussion and engagement between users.
* Game recommendation posts must include information such as games you have played in the past, what you enjoyed about them, and other detailed information to properly enable the community to assist you in a meaningful way. 
* Posts inciting discussion on a particular topic should make clear what the poster’s stance is on said topic.



***Rule 4: No Community Repetition***

* Redundant posts are subject to removal, we strongly encourage users to search and/or review recent posts before posting.
* Common sources of post repetition include, but are not limited to, game trailers, game opinions, choices between two games, etc.



***Rule 5: Provide Game Identification***

* Every post primarily focused on a particular game or games must identify the game(s) in the post title.



***Rule 6: Provide Spoiler Tags***

* During the first month following a game's launch, any relevant content posted from or about the game must have the spoiler tag enabled.
* Please err on the side of caution in this time period and utilize spoiler tags if at all in doubt.



***Rule 7: Meta Posts and Mod Interaction***

* Meta posts or comments regarding the subreddit itself, moderation decisions, or other non-soulslike topics at large, are prohibited.
* Moderators may make such meta posts at their discretion, and any comments or discussion in such threads are exempt from this rule.
* If you feel a meta topic of discussion is important or for any other reason need to communicate with the moderation team, please reach out to the moderators directly via modmail. DO NOT message individual moderators directly.



With the rules out of the way, here are some additional considerations and information pertaining to some of these rules that may help provide additional context:

**Regarding ""FromSoftware"" games being universally allowed:**

We have received comments that allowing content regarding all FromSoftware games to be posted allows for games like AC6, Kings Field & Nightreign to be discussed as well as other potential non-soulslike games. While this loophole exists, we believe the majority of the community agrees with the additional latitude we allow for FromSoftware titles as the company who birthed the genre. FromSoftware itself is hopelessly entwined with the definition and culture of soulslikes. Users still retain the power to upvote, downvote, or completely ignore any and all posts based on their own personal level of engagement with the given content.

**Regarding ""Non-Soulslike"" Games (or those that are debatably so):**  
  
As gamers, we are always looking for we think we would like and with soulslikes being so few and far between, we are happy (and encourage) users to discuss games you think soulslike fans will like, that are outside the genre (Claire 33 as a recent example). That said, these will be heavily monitored: They must be tagged correctly ('Not A Soulslike, But...') to set a reader’s expectations and the focus on the post must be why a soulslike fan will like the game. Due to the addition to the rule, the monthly stickied post will be removed going forward.

**Regarding ""Mod Discretion"" regarding ""what is or is not a soulslike"":**

This isn’t something that is taken lightly, but sometimes we only have users, trailers, steam tags and reviews to go off. We sadly cannot ensure that moderators will have sufficient coverage, time, or access to play every new game at launch. We will do our best to remain flexible as changes occur in and around the genre of soulslikes and will do our best to fairly evaluate games and content as these things occur. If you feel that there is any need to communicate disagreement with any of these decisions or to discuss specific meta-related discussions of a particular nature, please do no hesitate to reach out via modmail and we will address your request accordingly.

**Regarding ""Low Effort Posts"" and ""Game Recommendations"":**

The specific rule relating to game recommendation posts has been merged into our rule regarding low effort posts. The primary issue we as moderators, and you in the community, have historically raised regarding these posts ultimately all boil down to game recommendation posts that are otherwise also in violation of our low effort content rules. 

Furthermore, we recognize that the weekly ""Game Recommendations"" thread has not sufficiently worked to address this issue. Instead, we have added a new flair ('Game Recs') which must be used to easily identify the post, so people can choose to engage or not.

In an effort to prevent issues we have seen in the past regarding these type of posts dominating our front page content (particularly in low effort format), we feel we will be better able to address these underlying issues while still providing our community with a great resource to explore and discover new games to enjoy by requiring quality standards on game recommendation posts as well as requiring that such posts be sufficiently limited to avoid undue repetition.

Game recommendation posts will be monitored *heavily* and we will continue to evaluate these posts as a whole in an ongoing manner. As a warning to users, post  asking for game recommendations need to provide more context than simply “what should I play next?”, ""should I play X or Y?"", or ""is X worth playing?"". We want to maximally ensure our community is in a position to guide users to games they will genuinely enjoy and appreciate, but doing so requires sufficient effort on the part of the person seeking the recommendation, as well.

**Regarding ""Community Repetition"":**

We have reworked and reworded the prior ""no excessive posting"" rule. In the past, users have been frustrated if their post was removed when another similar post has been retained (this happens most frequently when numerous users post news or other timely announcements in a nearly simultaneous manner). While we appreciate the frustration when a post is removed, we also need to balance the needs of the community and we can best accomplish that by ensuring topics of discussion are centralized and not spread across multiple posts (particularly in short frames of time which additionally clutters up the front page). The new rule clarifies that posts will be judged against community-wide content, not just against your own prior posts.

One of the main purposes of this rule is to assist in managing game recommendations. Last year, we only had 8,000 members and 2/3rds of the front page was the exact same question, leaving content that was dull and users who were not interested in assisting. The engagement these posts get nowadays, when managed properly, is genuinely very high. As such, we want to continue allowing game recommendation posts, but also ensure the onus is on the poster to see if their question has been asked already (and to make sure the question has enough details to not trigger the ""Low Effort"" rule).

Reasonable exceptions will be ignored by the mods (e.g. we expect an increase of posts during a new launch and are happy to allow this). Please understand that our goal is not to stifle user posts or discussion, but to do our best to cultivate the best quality discussions we can facilitate.



**Final Thoughts**



Thank you for being a part of our community of soulslike gamers. We're excited about the growth we have seen both in our sub here, but also in the genre as whole. It's an exciting time to be a part of the soulslike community and there's no shortage of great games on the horizon. Take care!

HDR looks dull and washed out in every game I've tried... (The new AOC Q27G40XMN),"I recently bought the new AOC Q27G40XMN (1440p, Mini-LED, VA). This is my first experience with HDR at all. As far as I'm aware, the only calibration I can do in the monitor settings as far as HDR goes is adjusting the HDR Mode (I assume this means preset), which includes: DisplayHDR, HDR Picture, HDR Movie, and HDR Game. While in HDR, the only other picture settings I can configure are contrast (from 0-100, which is unavailable in DisplayHDR mode) and local dimming settings (off, low, medium, high). From my testing on HDR youtube videos (namely this one: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxnMg0I0LZM&ab\_channel=TFTCentral](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxnMg0I0LZM&ab_channel=TFTCentral) ), the ""HDR Game"" preset (which is also the default mode) with local dimming set to ""low"" seems to be the best, as anything above low local dimming removes too many details in dark scenery. The video looks gorgeous in HDR! Super black darks, super bright highlights. However, I have tested these games in HDR (confirmed that my Windows settings say ""HDR on"", my monitor settings say ""HDR Game"" to on, the games' settings say HDR is on, and the games are all in fullscreen):

Red Dead Redemption 2

Monster Hunter Wilds

Dragon's Dogma 2

Baldur's Gate 3

All these games tested in ""HDR Game"" mode with local dimming on low, contrast on 55 (these are the only PC games I own with HDR settings so far). They all looked very grey, dull, washed out. Worse than SDR.  Some of these titles are salvageable with shaders, but others looks better or the same in SDR. I'm very confused if I am missing calibration settings in some form of software or if I have a faulty monitor. But the HDR videos look sexy so idk. I have tried Nvidia filters as other posts suggest, but every single one makes me crash almost instantly sooo (which is a shame, some of them I enjoy...)

Reviving Omnivore: Measuring interest in re-hosting and maintaining Omnivore,"Hi! 
A lot of Obsidian users here used Omnivore, a beloved read-it-later service that was killed rapidly in a private buy-out.

I'm a developer interested in taking over / forking omnivore and re-hosting it as a service. 

It looks like a group of people have continued development on the open source version, which is great for developers, but my interest would be in hosting this version for non-developers to use, as a service. 

My main interests would be in:
- making it available as a cloud service again
- charging $1-$4 dollars to cover server costs or accepting donations, ideally the first because donations are unpredictable
- improving it continuously and solidifying the codebase along with the current work people are doing
- keeping all of my contributions open source
- intentful bug tracking and feature requests for the hosted version
- improving data export and portability, and other hosting options, so in the extreme event that it were killed again - users would not be left hanging (maybe even icloud support as an *option*)

I made a mailing list and a poll if you're interested and want to follow along:
https://omnivorenext.substack.com

About me:
I am a seasoned developer who has worked on every part of the stack at FAANG companies, startups, mid sized companies. I hate big tech, private equity, and how poor quality software has become. I know how to run a full fledged large-scale service well and would have fun doing this as a sort of farm-to-table software project and labor of love (for omnivore and obsidian!).

Samsung Odyssey+ Owners! Was this Headset ALWAYS Blurry? Was It Ever Really Sharp/In-focus?,"I own a bunch of HMDs but have had a real love/hate relationship with my Samsung Odyssey+ over the years. Today I dusted it off and plugged it in to see how it holds up today and was dismayed at how blurry the image is compared to all my other headsets. Much blurrier than I remembered it being.

Now, if you search for this issue, you'll find many posts from users who claim the picture on their Odyssey headsets USED to be much sharper and that something--Steam VR, Windows, WMR itself--changed along the way to cause the image to become blurrier than it used to be. There are several different proposed solutions but none that seem to actually fix the issue for a majority of users--myself very much included.

I know Samsung used some sort of special filter on the panel designed to eliminate the screen door effect, and that this definitely caused a certain level of blurriness particularly with objects that were farther away, which would seem to suggest that this was in fact, always an issue ... but still in my own memory and the memory of other users, it seems to have gotten much worse at some point. There are numerous pro reviews still available to read on the web and I don't remember most of them noting an issue with blurriness this severe, but maybe they just ... ignored it? 

So my question is: did we all just IMAGINE that the Samsung Odyssey+ looked a lot sharper at some point in the past and it was ALWAYS this blurry?

Or did something actually change in the software chain at some point to make this flaw a lot worse?",4,1,0,1,"The post describes a problem with the blurriness of the Samsung Odyssey+ headset, questioning if it was always blurry or if something changed.","While there are mentions of software changes potentially causing the issue, the problem seems to persist despite various software-based solutions, indicating it may not be primarily solvable through software.","The problem may require action beyond the user's control, such as changes by manufacturers or updates from companies like Samsung or software providers.",,high
"28 [M4F] UK - Fun, caring talkative introvert for the same?","Hi! I'm **Marc**. I'm **28**, and I live in **England**. I'm just putting my feelers out there to see if anybody is interested in me. Honestly, I'm open to dating or friendship. I don't have many friends, so why not? But I'm not desperate either :) I'm **open to long-distance**, but I should stress that other than Ireland, I doubt I would move far from Britain, because I don't think many places have the right balance of things that we do here.

I'm a talkative introvert. I mostly keep to myself, but when I really like somebody, I'm very open with them, and I care for them a lot. I'm just trying to get through life without too much chaos, while causing minimal harm :) I like occasional bits of silly fun - I'll grow up fully when I'm dead -, but I also know how to be serious - and life has not been suuuper kind to me these past few years, so I feel like a bit of an old man, even though I do not look like it. I'm definitely not a university student anymore - I can't relate to that mentality, do you understand me? I worked for 6 years after university in software development, but due to long-term illness I'm presently unemployed. I'm trying to get back into work, but I need to prioritise working on my health first. So I guess I'm a long-term investment, not a quick win :) Hence why I'm not on Tinder lol.

For certain, I don't 'want children', and I can't actually live with most pets. I just want a female partner. By all means stroke my head and call me a good boy if you want xD

I might be a giant nerd, but can I brag a little to offset that? I've been called 'cute' and 'handsome' by a number of women in the past :)) But am I your taste? Maybe - maybe not.

I'm not religious. I'm not very political - I have opinions of course, but I'm not an activist or whatever - at least not presently.

If you think I might make a good friend, or even a good boyfriend, feel free to take a chance on me :))

And if you're still not persuaded, then I wish you a good day or night, anyway!

Randomly got a package in the mail,"So about half a year ago, I think in October, I got an update for my Galahad lcd AIO that killed the screen. 

The firmware the connect software tried to install didn’t play nice or something and since then I’ve had a dead lcd and have had to set the pump speed through the bios to get everything working. 

I had opened a support ticket trying to get some help and went through some troubleshooting steps with someone for about a week before communications just stopped. 
I attempted multiple emails afterwards as late as January with no reply so I had just given up. The AIO was working for its cooling purposes so it just didn’t look pretty anymore lol. 

Fast forward to today and I got a notice I had a package at my door. I open it and to my surprise it’s a Galahad 2 LCD..

After like 5 months of ghosting me Lian Li randomly sends me a replacement AIO. Searched my email and on Monday I had one from a Mike saying my request had been approved and dispatched and they sincerely apologize for the delay caused by a shortage of raw materials. 

So now I have a new AIO and no motivation to replace it atm lol",4,1,0,1,The post describes a problem with a malfunctioning LCD screen on a cooling system due to a firmware update.,The problem was not solvable through software as the user had to rely on BIOS settings and eventually received a hardware replacement.,"The resolution required action from the manufacturer, Lian Li, to send a replacement unit.",resolved_problem,medium
Is replacing employees with AI even economically possible?,"So, as of this day and age, it's becoming very apparent that some companies are slowly replacing individuals with AI. CEOs of these companies give long lectures (or e-mails in the case of Fiverr's CEO) about why AI employees are better, cheaper and ""more efficient"". And of course, there's no denying that a well-trained AI could do many things a lot better, which is even if you ignore the fact that AI is essentially just software and software can be improved substantially every day.  
  
However, if you look at the Industrial Revolution: it caused people to look for other types of jobs and created a lot of new jobs because someone needed to build, fix and operate those same machines. Now, with AI, we have essentially created an alternative to a human, so it is far different from a machine user in a manufacturing facility. The thing is, ultimately, the Industrial Revolution had a positive outcome for employees since many such jobs prior to machines were unhealthy and dangerous.  
But with AI, I don't think it can be like that. There have been two thoughts going through my head that make it seem like it is fundamentally impossible to have AI have all jobs.

1. If a CEO decides that having AI Agents is better and cheaper than having humans, then that only works if it remains small scale (i.e., only entry-level jobs or contractors). Why? If every CEO replaced all employees with AI, that would mean that eventually, none of these people that used to have jobs will be able to afford anything, let alone the product of that same CEO that just replaced *everything*. At the end of the day, economy is about people being able to afford things + companies being able to offer whatever a customer wants. By replacing all jobs with AI, wouldn't you completely destroy the economy as a whole?
2. On the flip side of that, the only reason why things cost money is because of... well... the fact that there are people who want to get rewarded for their efforts. However, if all of their jobs are replaced with AI as well, wouldn't that mean that at some point, all basic needs could be free?

I don't see a world where an economy could work if we, the (mostly) non-CEOs don't even have money to afford anything. Now, there is of course a discussion for a Universal Base Income (UBI) which would work for the small percentage that gets laid off before everything is essentially AI-based.

So, ultimately, assuming that my two points could be true, wouldn't AI be both the end of our economy as well as allowing us humans to just do whatever we want instead of having to work — so being extremely positive in the end?

Advice on whether to take an SQL developer job.,"3 years experience (Web Development)
B.S. Comp Sci

Position Eliminated from last company in January. 

Ever since I got laid off or eliminated or whatever from my last job I’ve been looking for a new SWE role. I haven’t had a whole lot of luck. I’ve been shotgunning applications (around 2000). And been contacted by maybe 5-6 companies one of which I really liked and got to the final interview with last month and they went with someone with more experience in that particular stack. 

Here’s my dilemma I applied to an SQL developer job and I’ve had a few interviews and think I may get an offer. I also got contacted for another interview for a position at an org very closely associated with the one I had liked before but I expect their interview process to be very slow. So even if I got it I would have to make a decision on the SQL job first.

Would it be bad to take this SQL dev job assuming I get the offer? I’m torn because I don’t think I would enjoy the work as more development job. Additionally I’m scared my skills would suffer if I’m only using SQL and the companies other software they use. On the other hand it’s a job and the salary range is about 10k - 20k more than I made at my last job. It is also full remote which would be a bonus.

I’d appreciate any advice to help me think through this.

"1.5 Years of Unemployment: Lost, Learning and Looking for Direction","Hello everyone,

In this post, I want to share my 1.5 year period of unemployment, the mental challenges I faced and how I lost my direction. If you’re in a similar situation or have been through something like this before, please don’t leave without commenting. Your advice could be incredibly valuable to me.

I worked as a junior developer at a company for about 2.5 years. I was involved in a real-time object detection project written in C++, integrating Edge AI and IoT. Since it was a startup environment, there weren’t many employees so I had to deal with many different areas such as testing, benchmarking, profiler tools, CI/CD processes and documentation. Moreover, the senior developer (team lead) was unable to review my code or help to my technical growth due to the workload. Although I tried hard to improve and share what I learned with the team, I didn't receive the same level of feedback or collaboration in return.

After some time, the company decided to create its own Linux distribution using the Yocto Project. During this process, they had a deal with a consulting firm and I was tasked with supporting their work. Initially, I was responsible for defining the project requirements and communicating details about the necessary hardware, libraries, and tools. However, the consultancy was canceled shortly afterward, so I ended up handling the entire Yocto process alone. Then, I started learning Yocto, Linux and embedded systems on my own. I developed the necessary system structures for boards such as Raspberry Pi and NXP i.MX. The structure I developed is now used in thousands of devices in the field.

During my one-on-one meetings with the senior developer, I repeatedly expressed my desire to write more code and my need to improve my C++ skills. I also mentioned that I lacked an environment where I could grow. Each time, he told me we needed to finish the first version of the project (V1) and that he would help afterward. But as V1 turned into V1.1, then V1.2. 2.5 years passed and not much changed. During this time, I continued to improve my skills in the embedded Linux field on my own. In our final conversation, I told him that I was stuck technically and couldn’t make technical progress. He said there was nothing that could be done. At that point, I resigned because I couldn't take it anymore.

After resigning, I tried to improve myself in areas such as the Linux kernel, device drivers, U-Boot and DeviceTree. Although I had previously worked on configuring these topics but I hadn’t had the chance to write actual code for a real product.

Although I wasn’t good enough, I tried to contribute by working on open-source projects. I started actively contributing to the OpenEmbedded/Yocto community. I added Yocto support for some old boards and made others work with current versions. I worked on CVE, recipe updates and solving warnings/errors encountered in CI/CD processes.

I want to work on better projects and contribute more to the Linux kernel and Yocto. However, I struggle to contribute code because I have knowledge gaps in core areas such as C, C++, data structures and algorithms. While I have a wide range of knowledge, it is not deep enough.

Right now, I don’t know how to move forward. My mind is cluttered, and I’m not being productive. Not having someone to guide me makes things even harder. At 28 years old, I feel like I’m falling behind, and I feel like the time I’ve spent hasn’t been efficient. Despite having 2.5 years of work experience, I feel inadequate. I have so many gaps, and I’m mentally exhausted. I can’t make a proper plan for myself. I try to work, but I’m not sure if I’m being productive or doing the right things.

For the past 1.5 years, I’ve been applying and continue to apply for ""Embedded Linux Engineer"" positions but I haven’t received any positive responses. Some of my applications are focused on user-space C/C++ development and I think, I'm failing the interviews.

Here are some questions I have on my mind:

\- Is a 1.5–2 year gap a major disadvantage when looking for a job?

\- Is it possible to create a supportive environment instead of working alone? (I sent emails to nearly 100 developers contributing to the Linux kernel, expressing my willingness to volunteer in projects but I didn’t get any responses.)

\- What is the best strategy for overcoming my tendency to have knowledge in many areas but not in-depth understanding?

\- Which topics should I dive deeper into for the most benefit?

\- Am I making a mistake by focusing on multiple areas like C, C++, Yocto and the Linux kernel at the same time?

\- What kind of project ideas should I pursue that will both help me grow technically and increase my chances of finding a job?

\- Does my failure so far mean I’m just not good at software development?

\- I feel like I can’t do anything on my own. I struggle to make progress without a clear project or roadmap but I also can’t seem to create one. How can I break out of this cycle?

\- What’s the most important question I should be asking myself but haven’t yet?

Writing this feels like I’m pouring my heart out. I really feel lost. I want to move forward and find a way, but I don't know how. Advice from experienced people would mean a lot to me. Thank you for reading. I’m sorry for taking up your time. I hope I’ve been able to express myself clearly.

Is now a good time to get into car sales?,"I’ve been in sales for over a decade, mostly high end independent clothing stores where I made very good money; I would do over a million in sales in my sleep as it was a short sales cycle and I liked the business. 

Right now I’m in fine art selling at an art gallery and it’s awful due to inconsistency. Some months I’ll sell 175k, then nothing the next month, then the next month I’ll sell over 100k through financing, then crumbs for a few months, etc. I can make my whole month selling one piece, but last year that only happened on about five ups.

The cycle is longer but it’s also not the same as clothing, cars, or even watches because to me there’s less gratification of being seen *in* something and much less of a necessity as well. People may not need a Rolex or a 911 but those are areas where many people will buy what’s in their budget. People like to look at art but not necessarily pay to own it. 

I live very close to a car mall and have considered getting into car sales before. Theres a solid brand mix of luxury German, Toytoa, Honda, Subaru, Land Rover/Jag, and Porsche. Most of the higher tier brands command some car sales experience for applicants from what I’ve seen on Indeed, but I was thinking of getting into a volume store, especially if the pay plan is decent and I don’t have to work bell to bell. 

Tariffs, and unstable economy would usually mean hold onto what you have and stay put, but my savings is rapidly depleting and I will be in bad shape if I don’t turn things around very soon. I’m really not qualified for much else, and software sales or something similar would require me to relocate.

From Infrastructure to Influence: How Dacxi Chain Is Redefining the Power Structures of Global Capit,"https://preview.redd.it/ct62hhx7it0f1.png?width=1120&format=png&auto=webp&s=24ff2912c4b63a81d73c48bef037f37833f2f15d

The story of global equity crowdfunding is often told through the lens of regulation, democratization, and technology. But that story is incomplete. The real shift underway is structural — not just in how capital is raised, but in who controls the mechanisms of capital formation itself.

At the center of this shift is **Dacxi Chain**, not merely as a technological infrastructure, but as a **neutral, connective force that challenges the dominance of financial silos**. In the same way that open-source protocols disrupted proprietary software models, Dacxi Chain is quietly redrawing the map of capital flow — and with it, the global balance of economic opportunity.

# The Hidden Politics of Capital Access

Despite the rhetoric of globalization, capital remains stubbornly local. Gatekeepers — from regulators to institutional networks — still shape who gets funded and who gets left behind. The irony? In a digital-first world, a founder in Lagos can build a product for users in London, but may never get funded by investors in either.

That’s not a technology gap. It’s a structural one.

Dacxi Chain flips this equation by introducing a **shared protocol layer** that links national crowdfunding platforms into a **collaborative global marketplace**. But more importantly, it reconfigures power:

* **Platforms become nodes in a network, not islands**
* **Investors gain access to global deal flow, not just local pipelines**
* **Regulatory compliance becomes programmable, not prohibitive**

This is not a minor efficiency upgrade. It’s a reengineering of how economic influence is distributed.

# Capital Without Borders. Influence Without Bias.

In traditional systems, capital follows influence. Dacxi Chain reverses this. By embedding trust, identity, and compliance into its fabric, it allows capital to flow on the merit of the opportunity — not on the location of the founder or the connections of the lead investor.

Consider what that unlocks:

* A climate-tech startup in Indonesia can raise from retail investors in Germany and institutional backers in Canada.
* Diaspora communities can invest in local innovation without friction.
* Regulators can approve participation based on shared standards rather than reinventing oversight jurisdiction by jurisdiction.

This is more than financial plumbing. It’s a **redistribution of influence**, empowering regions, people, and platforms that have historically been excluded from early-stage investing.

# The Network Is the Market

Dacxi Chain’s most radical idea isn’t technical. It’s economic: **that the future market for private equity will be defined by the networks that distribute it — not the institutions that guard it.**

In this model:

* Trust isn’t brokered, it’s embedded
* Verification isn’t paper-based, it’s interoperable
* Governance isn’t an afterthought, it’s automated

In effect, Dacxi Chain doesn’t just make equity crowdfunding borderless — it makes it **platformless**. Any regulated local platform plugged into the network gains access to global liquidity, reputation systems, governance tooling, and investor networks — while retaining sovereignty over their own deals and community.

This is a far cry from the top-down models of fintech expansion. It’s **bottom-up globalization** — one where innovation travels through protocol, not power.

# The Future Is Federated

As global capital markets evolve, centralization is no longer the endgame. What’s emerging instead is a federated model of trust and access — one where infrastructure is shared, but relationships are local; where platforms co-own rather than compete for distribution.

Dacxi Chain, in this light, isn’t a product. It’s a **paradigm**. It replaces friction with federation. And in doing so, it offers a rare thing in global finance: **a protocol that empowers without colonizing**.

# A Call to Builders, Not Just Investors

If the internet age taught us anything, it’s that the systems we build define the futures we get. Dacxi Chain represents an opportunity — not just for investment, but for participation in the design of a new capital market.

It invites local platforms to link up, regulators to lean in, and investors to look beyond borders. Not in search of the next unicorn, but in service of a global economy that allocates capital based on **potential, not privilege**.",3,0,0,0,,,,,high

After resigning, I tried to improve myself in areas such as the Linux kernel, device drivers, U-Boot and DeviceTree. Although I had previously worked on configuring these topics but I hadn’t had the chance to write actual code for a real product.

Although I wasn’t good enough, I tried to contribute by working on open-source projects. I started actively contributing to the OpenEmbedded/Yocto community. I added Yocto support for some old boards and made others work with current versions. I worked on CVE, recipe updates and solving warnings/errors encountered in CI/CD processes.

I want to work on better projects and contribute more to the Linux kernel and Yocto. However, I struggle to contribute code because I have knowledge gaps in core areas such as C, C++, data structures and algorithms. While I have a wide range of knowledge, it is not deep enough.

Right now, I don’t know how to move forward. My mind is cluttered, and I’m not being productive. Not having someone to guide me makes things even harder. At 28 years old, I feel like I’m falling behind, and I feel like the time I’ve spent hasn’t been efficient. Despite having 2.5 years of work experience, I feel inadequate. I have so many gaps, and I’m mentally exhausted. I can’t make a proper plan for myself. I try to work, but I’m not sure if I’m being productive or doing the right things.

For the past 1.5 years, I’ve been applying and continue to apply for ""Embedded Linux Engineer"" positions but I haven’t received any positive responses. Some of my applications are focused on user-space C/C++ development and I think, I'm failing the interviews.

Here are some questions I have on my mind:

\- Is a 1.5–2 year gap a major disadvantage when looking for a job?

\- Is it possible to create a supportive environment instead of working alone? (I sent emails to nearly 100 developers contributing to the Linux kernel, expressing my willingness to volunteer in projects but I didn’t get any responses.)

\- What is the best strategy for overcoming my tendency to have knowledge in many areas but not in-depth understanding?

\- Which topics should I dive deeper into for the most benefit?

\- Am I making a mistake by focusing on multiple areas like C, C++, Yocto and the Linux kernel at the same time?

\- What kind of project ideas should I pursue that will both help me grow technically and increase my chances of finding a job?

\- Does my failure so far mean I’m just not good at software development?

\- I feel like I can’t do anything on my own. I struggle to make progress without a clear project or roadmap but I also can’t seem to create one. How can I break out of this cycle?

\- What’s the most important question I should be asking myself but haven’t yet?

Writing this feels like I’m pouring my heart out. I really feel lost. I want to move forward and find a way, but I don't know how. Advice from experienced people would mean a lot to me. Thank you for reading. I’m sorry for taking up your time. I hope I’ve been able to express myself clearly.

Looking to make a waterfall chart,"Hello. I am looking to make a waterfall chart similar to this: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z\_XZOa2-6CQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_XZOa2-6CQ) . I have also included a picture of what I am looking to do for anyone not wanting to watch a video.

I have found some examples, but they are all the 3D versions instead of what can be found on software defined radio type interfaces. All of the examples I could find were related to FFTs, but the plot I have included is what the raw data looks like (so there is no frequency domain).

I have a histogram of particle size vs counts, and I am wanting to have another chart that converts the counts to color intensity to view more data over time. If someone could point me in the right direction that would be appreciated.

Thanks.

"1.5 Years of Unemployment - Lost, Learning and Looking for Direction","Hello everyone,

In this post, I want to share my 1.5 year period of unemployment, the mental challenges I faced and how I lost my direction. If you’re in a similar situation or have been through something like this before, please don’t leave without commenting. Your advice could be incredibly valuable to me.

I worked as a junior developer at a company for about 2.5 years. I was involved in a real-time object detection project written in C++, integrating Edge AI and IoT. Since it was a startup environment, there weren’t many employees so I had to deal with many different areas such as testing, benchmarking, profiler tools, CI/CD processes and documentation. Moreover, the senior developer (team lead) was unable to review my code or help to my technical growth due to the workload. Although I tried hard to improve and share what I learned with the team, I didn't receive the same level of feedback or collaboration in return.

After some time, the company decided to create its own Linux distribution using the Yocto Project. During this process, they had a deal with a consulting firm and I was tasked with supporting their work. Initially,  I was responsible for defining the project requirements and communicating details about the necessary hardware, libraries, and tools. However, the consultancy was canceled shortly afterward, so I ended up handling the entire Yocto process alone. Then, I started learning Yocto, Linux and embedded systems on my own. I developed the necessary system structures for boards such as  Raspberry Pi and NXP i.MX. The structure I developed is now used in thousands of devices in the field.

During my one-on-one meetings with the senior developer, I repeatedly expressed my desire to write more code and my need to improve my C++ skills. I also mentioned that I lacked an environment where I could grow. Each time, he told me we needed to finish the first version of the project (V1) and that he would help afterward. But as V1 turned into V1.1, then V1.2. 2.5 years passed and not much changed. During this time, I continued to improve my skills in the embedded Linux field on my own. In our final conversation, I told him that I was stuck technically and couldn’t make technical progress. He said there was nothing that could be done. At that point, I resigned because I couldn't take it anymore.

After resigning, I tried to improve myself in areas such as the Linux kernel, device drivers, U-Boot and DeviceTree. Although I had previously worked on configuring these topics but I hadn’t had the chance to write actual code for a real product.

Starting PM role,"Starting as a Product Manager at a startup (only PM on the team). Don’t have traditional SaaS PM experience but greater experience running NPI programs and product launch across large orgs. 

New to Jira and Scrum/Kanban in the SaaS so I’m curious how you guys recommend to structure the product planning and prioritization. 

The dev team works off a scrum board with 2 week sprints (1 service 3 platforms, and sub products / features within)

There’s a product backlog attached to the scrum board which gets updated and refined and the few days before new sprint starts we pick upcoming sprints goals from the backlog 


There are also a lot of requests that come randomly from clients, some that need to be done during active sprint, some that can go through the backlog. For some items we need PRDs or heavy UI/UX input before handing to dev. 

I’m not sure what the best way to organize this would be since I’m new to Jira as well

I’m thinking the scrum board continues to be managed by the Tech lead

And I lead a product board. One of the columns would be all new requests (to track what’s from which client, add multiple of one type of request to the same ticket) and move that through the columns that I’m thinking would be (input idea / request, reviewed, details added (Prd/UiUx), and transferred to dev or sprint backlog. 

The goal would be that we review the product board consistently and prioritize it, making sure the week before the next sprint starts we have enough detailed work load ready for Dev to take on, plus also save capacity for bugs and emergency requests coming up during sprint

How would you guys organize the flow of activities and structure your product planning process from ideation to shipment  when you are the first PM in the startup and building the product team as well

Is this insane micromanaging? (rant),"Can I just check if I'm being crazy here, or if this is just normal, as I feel like I'm being gaslit by my boss here.

So I'm a senior software developer, I work for a software house, and am currently working on a project that I started 1 year ago from the first initial commit, to now where it is grossing £3.5m per year, and we haven't even really gotten started yet with scaling customers, so that number can scale a lot higher. We started selling the service just 2 months ago. As we're now making bank, the boss is taking more if a leading role in this project and is starting to pay more attention to it.

I am the sole dev on this project. I do front end, back end, DevOps, infrastructure, support, tests, documentation, project management, product ownership, the whole shebang. Literally everything you can conceive as a functional product in this business was built by my own hands, while our client handles the business side of things himself. I work frankly a ridiculous amount of hours, and am on call 24/7. (We did hire a dev a few weeks ago, but he has yet to contribute anything and is still learning the code base, he does seem to know his shit)

And to be clear, *I'm fine with this.* I get paid well. So it's worth sacrificing my life for this, and putting up with the bullshit that comes with this arrangement for at least a few years until I have enough money to have options.

However, this morning my boss rings me up and rants at me for not working correctly. He says, every unit of code I write from now on should be its own commit, and attached to its own work item on azure devops that is itself documented, and discussed with management beforehand. Every single unit of code. He is mad because, as a solo dev, I don't really have any need to commit very often. I'm not collaborating with anybody. so I usually commit full features. I.e, if there is a button that does a thing, I usually submit the front end, backend, and infrastructure requirements of that button as a single commit when its done. Which are themselves behind feature flags. He also wants to be able to see a daily progression of commits so we can have daily stand-ups to discuss the work I'm doing. He doesn't want me committing once per week with a big feature, because the volume of code I'm writing overwhelms him, and he can't be bothered to look over it at all (my code is also diligently commented, so it's obvious what everything is doing). So he's demanding I change my workflow, and day and structure it around a daily stand-up to make sure boxes are checked, and agile work items are linked together and documented instead of delivering... well, quite literally millions in value to our client.

That's insane, right? What do I do here...? Or am I being unreasonable? My boss is extremely stubborn, and always falls back to ""I've got x decades of experience in software, you don't, I know what's best"", when in reality his code is stoned college junior level, he's just a business man that manages companies. I feel like this is a totally wild expectation lumped on top of an already wild expectation that I be *every* tech department in this business. I don't really want to leave, the client and I have a super good relationship, and my options are superb. What I can I do to explain to him that helicoptering in occasionally and demanding I change my entire workflow is not the play? I feel like this will 3x any development time I have because I'll constantly be compartmentalizing work, and managing work items and documentation of each work item nobody is ever going to read in a thousand years.
