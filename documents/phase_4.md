# Phase 4: Refinement & Iteration

## Error Analysis:
- [ ] Manually examine a sample of misclassified posts from your test set.
- [ ] Identify patterns in errors: Is it sarcasm? Implicit meaning? Lack of context? Specific keywords being misinterpreted?

## Improve Data & Preprocessing:
- [ ] Based on error analysis, refine your text cleaning steps (e.g., add rules for specific Reddit slang, handle negations more explicitly, improve emoji handling).
- [ ] If necessary, re-label ambiguous or inconsistent examples in your training data.

## Model Hyperparameter Tuning (if applicable):
- [ ] For traditional ML, experiment with different C values (Logistic Regression/SVM), n_estimators (Random Forest), etc.
- [ ] For Transformers, adjust learning rate, batch size, number of epochs, and fine-tuning layers.

## Consider Advanced Techniques (if needed):
- [ ] If results are still unsatisfactory and you have sufficient unlabeled Reddit data, consider Domain-Adaptive Pre-training for your Transformer model.
