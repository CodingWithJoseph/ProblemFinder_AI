# Reddit Problem Finder: Actionable EDA & Feature Engineering Guide

## 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Checklist

### Basic Dataset Analysis
- [ ] Check dataset dimensions (rows/columns)
- [ ] Examine data types and verify consistency
- [ ] Identify and handle missing values
- [ ] Review sample posts to understand data structure

### Text Statistics Analysis
- [ ] Calculate title length distribution (characters and words)
- [ ] Calculate body length distribution (characters and words)
- [ ] Analyze paragraph count and structure
- [ ] Generate summary statistics (min, max, mean, median)

### Question Pattern Analysis
- [ ] Count question marks per post
- [ ] Identify posts starting with question words
- [ ] Calculate question-to-sentence ratio
- [ ] Extract common question phrases

### Subreddit Analysis
- [ ] Count posts per subreddit
- [ ] Identify most common subreddits
- [ ] Compare text characteristics across subreddits
- [ ] Check for subreddit-specific patterns

### Visualization Tasks
- [ ] Create histograms of text length metrics
- [ ] Generate word clouds from titles and bodies
- [ ] Plot subreddit distribution bar chart
- [ ] Create correlation heatmap of numeric features

## 2. Feature Engineering Steps

### Text Length Features
- [ ] Add `title_char_count` and `title_word_count` columns
- [ ] Add `body_char_count` and `body_word_count` columns
- [ ] Calculate `text_density` (words/characters ratio)
- [ ] Determine number of paragraphs in body

### Question-Related Features
- [ ] Count question marks (`question_count`)
- [ ] Create boolean feature for posts starting with questions
- [ ] Identify common question patterns with regex
- [ ] Calculate question-to-text ratio

### Sentiment Analysis Options
- [ ] **Option 1: Use existing libraries**
  - [ ] Implement TextBlob for quick sentiment scoring
  - [ ] Use VADER from NLTK for social media-focused sentiment
  - [ ] Add `title_sentiment` and `body_sentiment` columns
  
- [ ] **Option 2: Train custom sentiment model**
  - [ ] Gather labeled sentiment data (optional)
  - [ ] Extract relevant features (word embeddings, n-grams)
  - [ ] Train simple sentiment classifier
  - [ ] Apply model to generate sentiment scores

### Problem-Indicating Keywords
- [ ] Create list of problem-indicating phrases
```python
problem_phrases = [
    "need help", "looking for", "is there a", "wish there was",
    "can't find", "how do I", "struggle with", "any tool for",
    "is there any", "help me", "solution for"
  ]
```
- [ ] Count occurrences of each phrase
- [ ] Create aggregate `problem_phrase_count` feature
- [ ] Create boolean features for common phrases

### Additional Text Features
- [ ] Extract URLs mentioned (potential existing solutions)
- [ ] Count specific characters (%, $, numbers)
- [ ] Identify technical terminology frequency
- [ ] Calculate readability scores

## 3. Implementation Order

1. Start with basic EDA to understand dataset
2. Implement simple numerical features (counts, lengths)
3. Add question detection features
4. Implement sentiment analysis (start with library approach)
5. Add problem phrase detection
6. Create visualizations to analyze patterns
7. Document insights and patterns discovered

## 4. Sentiment Analysis Approach

For sentiment analysis, a staged approach is recommended:

### Stage 1: Quick Implementation
Use pre-trained sentiment analysis tools:
```python
from textblob import TextBlob
from nltk.sentiment.vader import SentimentIntensityAnalyzer

# TextBlob approach
data['title_sentiment_tb'] = data['title'].apply(lambda x: TextBlob(x).sentiment.polarity)

# VADER approach (better for social media text)
sid = SentimentIntensityAnalyzer()
data['body_sentiment_vader'] = data['body'].apply(lambda x: sid.polarity_scores(x)['compound'])
```

### Stage 2: Custom Model (If Needed)
If the pre-trained models don't capture the specific sentiment patterns in your data:
1. Label a subset of posts with sentiment scores
2. Extract features (TF-IDF, embeddings)
3. Train a regression model to predict sentiment
4. Apply to full dataset

## 5. Tools & Libraries Required

- **Data manipulation**: pandas, numpy
- **Visualization**: matplotlib, seaborn, wordcloud
- **Text processing**: NLTK, spaCy, TextBlob
- **Sentiment analysis**: VADER, TextBlob
- **Pattern matching**: regex

This guide provides a structured approach to analyzing and extracting features from your Reddit posts dataset. Start with the simple steps and gradually implement more complex features as you gain insights into what distinguishes problem-describing posts.
