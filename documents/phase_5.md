# Phase 5: Deployment & Actionable Insights

## Develop an Inference Pipeline:
- [ ] Create a script or API endpoint that takes raw Reddit post text, applies your full preprocessing pipeline, and then uses your trained model to predict the label.

## Integrate with Reddit Data Source:
- [ ] Use the Reddit API (e.g., PRAW library) to fetch new posts from relevant subreddits (r/startups, r/Entrepreneur, r/smallbusiness, specific industry subreddits, etc.).

## Automate Analysis & Reporting:
- [ ] Periodically fetch new posts, run them through your model, and store the results (e.g., in a database).
- [ ] Create a dashboard or generate automated reports to:
  - [ ] Display the count of "Pain Point" and "Market Opportunity" posts over time.
  - [ ] Show the actual text of these identified posts.
  - [ ] (Optional but Recommended): Integrate with Topic Modeling (e.g., LDA, BERTopic) on the identified "Pain Point" and "Market Opportunity" posts to cluster similar themes and reveal overarching trends.

## Human Review & Validation:
- [ ] Establish a process for your team to regularly review the model's top predictions to validate their accuracy and extract deeper qualitative insights. This is crucial for truly understanding the market.
